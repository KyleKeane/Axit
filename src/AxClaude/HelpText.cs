          Ctrl+Shift+R: force Claude to restart in the same folder with the same arguments, after a confirmation

          F1: this list
          Alt+F4: close AxClaude (asks first while Claude is working)

        Message field
          Enter: send (an empty field sends a plain Enter to Claude)
          Shift+Enter: new line
          Page Up, Page Down: one screen of the field up or down, or the first or last line of the message
          Escape: does nothing; a reminder says that Shift+Escape interrupts Claude
          Ctrl+Up, Ctrl+Down: send Up or Down to Claude

        Conversation

          h and Shift+H: next and previous heading. 1 to 6: heading of that level
            (Input and Output lines are level 1, Claude's headings level 2 and deeper)
          c and Shift+C: next and previous "claude:" line
          t and Shift+T: next and previous tool line
          p and Shift+P: next and previous paragraph (the first line after a blank line)
          e and Shift+E: next and previous error or warning
          d and Shift+D: next and previous "done" line at the end of a reply

          m: bookmark this line (a "Bookmark 1" line appears above it), or take the bookmark away again
          k and Shift+K: next and previous bookmark, read together with the line it marks
          Enter: copy the line into the message field under a marker line and go there, to comment on it
          Backspace: back to the line you were on before the last jump; again for the jump before that
          Shift with the arrow keys, or Ctrl+A: select text. Ctrl+C: copy the selection. New output waits while text is selected
          Escape: clear the selection, or go to the message field

        When Claude asks something
          A list of the answers takes the message field's place; the question is read each time you arrive there
          Tab, Shift+Tab, Ctrl+Tab or F6: between the conversation and the answers
          Up, Down, or an answer's number: choose (the number again: the next answer starting with it; Shift and the number: back; 0: answers 1 to 9)
          Page Up, Page Down: ten answers. Home, End: the first or last. Space: tick, when several answers are allowed
          Enter: answer. Escape: cancel the question, or go back a step
          The message field comes back when Claude has your answer

        Notices
          AxClaude's questions, errors and help texts appear inside the window, in place of the conversation.
          Tab moves between the text, a field and the buttons. Enter chooses the main button. Escape closes the notice.

        Claude Code itself
          Type /help in the message field and press Enter for Claude Code's own commands.
          The Help menu opens the Claude Code documentation in your browser.
