# AxClaude — Project Specification

Describes AxClaude 1.3.0 (2026-09-20). Every feature is built; this document is kept in step with the code (a behaviour change updates it in the same commit).

---

## 1. Summary

AxClaude is a small, self-contained Windows desktop application for a blind developer who uses the NVDA screen reader. It runs the Claude Code CLI (`claude --ax-screen-reader`) inside a Windows pseudo console (ConPTY), sends what the user types in a plain input field to that console, and turns everything the console prints into a **line-by-line transcript** in a read-only text view. The transcript is navigable with NVDA-style single-key commands (`h` headings, `i` the user's own inputs, `o` the start of each reply) and carries marker lines that the app inserts around every exchange. The app starts against a project folder, like `claude` itself, and the folder can be changed from a menu.

The app is **not** a terminal emulator. It relies on Claude Code's screen reader mode, which prints flat, labelled, linear text, and it only understands the small set of control sequences that ConPTY emits for that output.

## 2. Goals and non-goals

Goals:

- **G1 Screen reader first.** Everything works with NVDA and the keyboard only. Focus, names, roles and announcements are designed, not left to defaults.
- **G2 Lightweight.** One WinForms executable, no third-party runtime dependencies, starts in well under a second, idles at negligible CPU.
- **G3 Faithful.** Everything Claude Code prints in screen reader mode ends up in the transcript, in order, once.
- **G4 Structured.** The transcript is navigable by structure (inputs, replies, headings, tool activity, prompts), not only by line.
- **G5 Project aware.** Claude runs in a chosen folder, and the app always shows which.
- **G6 Robust.** Startup dialogs, crashes, exit and restarts are handled; the UI never freezes on console I/O.

Non-goals: a general terminal emulator (colours, the alternate screen, mouse reporting are ignored; only Claude Code in screen reader mode is supported); the Claude API, the Agent SDK or `-p --output-format stream-json` (D3); other platforms (Windows 10 1809 or later only); a mouse-first UI.

## 3. Users and scenarios

Primary user: a blind software developer on Windows 11 with NVDA, keyboard only, who already uses Claude Code and wants a calmer, navigable way to read its output than a terminal window.

| Id | Scenario | What must be true |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| S1 | Start on a project | `axclaude C:\src\myproject` (or the menu) starts Claude there; the title, status bar and Project menu name the folder. |
| S2 | Ask and read | Type, Enter, hear that Claude finished, Ctrl+Tab, Shift+O lands on the start of the latest reply, read down with the arrows. |
| S3 | Answer a prompt | A permission prompt or y/n question appears as plain lines; "Claude asks" is spoken; the user types `1` or `y` and presses Enter. |
| S4 | Review a long reply | `h` / Shift+H move between headings; `1`..`6` by level. |
| S5 | Recall what was asked | `i` / Shift+I move between the user's inputs. |
| S6 | Switch project | Project → Change folder… → the standard folder picker → Claude restarts there; a system line and an announcement confirm it. |
| S7 | Resume | `axclaude C:\src\myproject` starts Claude on the last conversation in the folder (`--continue` is the default, FR-9.1); New session (Ctrl+N) offers a fresh one, a resume and plan mode (FR-8.6). |
| S8 | Claude stops | The transcript says so, the app announces it, Restart is one keystroke away. |
| S9 | Interrupt | Shift+Escape. Plain Escape in the input field is guarded (FR-2.3, D20). |

## 4. Background: Claude Code in screen reader mode

Verified on 2026-09-18 against Claude Code **2.1.277** (native build) and https://code.claude.com/docs/en/accessibility.

### 4.1 Documented behaviour

- Enabled with `claude --ax-screen-reader`, `CLAUDE_AX_SCREEN_READER=1`, or the `axScreenReader` setting. The first line printed is `[Screen Reader Mode: on via flag]`.
- Output is flat text: no boxes, no colour cues, no redraws of unchanged content; spinners are static text; tables read as `Header: value` sentences. The `tui` setting is ignored.
- Every message starts with a label: `you:`, `claude:`, `thinking:`, `tool:`, `tool error:`, `error:`, `warning:`, `Permission Required:`, `Cost:` (at exit).
- Menus become numbered lists followed by an `Enter selection` prompt; the user types the number and presses Enter. Yes/no questions take a typed `y` or `n` and Enter.
- Two pauses exist for terminals: `CLAUDE_AX_STARTUP_QUIET_MS` (3 s after the confirmation line) and `CLAUDE_AX_PREPARK_MS` (50 ms with the cursor parked before a changed line). Both are set to `0` (FR-1.3).
- The **terminal bell** rings when a reply finishes, when a prompt needs an answer, and when a tool that ran longer than 5 s finishes: the app's primary "Claude needs you" signal. OSC 133 marks are also emitted at turn boundaries (unused).
- Shift+Tab cycles permission modes and prints an announcement such as `[plan mode on]` once. Alt+M also cycles on Windows.
- Keys: Enter submits; Escape interrupts or closes a dialog; Ctrl+C interrupts or clears input; Ctrl+D twice exits, as does `/exit`; Up/Down browse history; Tab accepts a completion; Ctrl+U / Ctrl+K / Ctrl+W edit the draft.
- Multi-line pastes collapse to `[Pasted text #N +M lines]`; bracketed paste mode is on (`ESC[?2004h`).

### 4.2 The stream at startup (`probe.vt`, 120×40)

```
ESC[?9001h ESC[?1004h ESC[?25l ESC[2J ESC[m ESC[H ESC]0;claude BEL? ESC[?25h
[Screen Reader Mode: on via flag] CR LF
ESC[?2004h ESC[?2031h ESC[?1004h ESC[>0q ESC[?u ESC[?25l
Permission Required: Accessing workspace: CR LF
<folder path> CR LF ... y. Yes, I trust this folder CR LF n. No, exit CR LF Enter y/n: CR LF
Enter to confirm · Esc to cancel ESC[11;12H ESC[?25h
```

1. The first sequences (win32-input-mode request, focus events, clear, title) come from ConPTY and are tolerated.
2. The client asks for bracketed paste, synchronized output, focus reporting, the terminal version and the kitty keyboard protocol. None needs an answer.
3. The workspace trust dialog is a flat `y/n` prompt shown the first time a folder is used.
4. The cursor is positioned with CUP onto the input line: cursor positioning happens even in screen reader mode, to park the caret and redraw the region below the static transcript.

### 4.3 After the trust prompt (`session.vt`)

- The dialog area was cleared row by row (`ESC[2;1H ESC[K CR LF ESC[K ...`) and replaced by the session header, `auto mode on (shift+tab to cycle)`, `effort: xhigh · /effort` and the prompt.
- A second one-time dialog then overwrote rows 5 and below. Startup dialogs are unpredictable in number; never assume the prompt is ready after a fixed delay.
- A message sent while a y/n dialog was open produced `Please answer y or n.` once; later invalid input was ignored silently. Dialog lines must be shown faithfully.
- Rows are rewritten from column 1 and end with `ESC[K`, so trailing whitespace is not significant.

### 4.4 A conversation (`session4.vt`, 120×40, and the fixtures)

**Frames.** Every redraw is bracketed by `ESC[?25l` and `ESC[?25h`. A frame moves the cursor with CUP to the first row of the *dynamic block*, rewrites that row and the rows below it (each ending with `ESC[K` and `CR LF`), skips unchanged rows with another CUP, erases rows left over from a taller frame, and parks the cursor on the prompt row. Rows above the block are never touched again. A frame taller than the screen scrolls with `CR LF` on the bottom row.

**The dynamic block.** Idle: the mode line and the prompt row `$`. Working: a spinner row (`Forming…`, changing every second), sometimes a `Tip: …` row, the mode line with ` · esc to interrupt`, the prompt row. A multi-line draft adds `ctrl+g to edit in Notepad` above the prompt. The slash-command list and a dialog's `Enter to confirm · Esc to cancel` hint are drawn **below** the cursor row.

**A turn.** `you: What is 2+2?` replaces the mode line; a spinner row is rewritten in place; then `ESC]133;C ESC]133;D BEL`; then the final frame: `claude: 2 + 2 = 4`, the turn summary `Baked for 1s · done 2:47 PM`, the mode line, the prompt.

Facts the design depends on:

1. **Enter must be a separate write.** `text\r` in one write became a pasted two-line draft. `text`, then `\r` later, submits reliably.
2. **The `you:` echo.** After submit, Claude rewrites the first dynamic row as `you: <text>`; a multi-line message continues on unlabelled rows. Slash commands and dialog answers produce no `you:` line.
3. **Reply rendering.** `claude: ` starts the reply; markdown is plain text: headings lose their `#`, the first block shares the `claude:` row, a later heading is a short row between blank rows, list items keep `- `. **No SGR styling** except dim around the resume hint at exit. Heading detection is structural (§7.6).
4. **Hard wrapping.** Claude wraps long lines at the console width with `CR LF`; a continuation row can begin with a space. A wide console (D9) avoids most of it.
5. **Tool activity.** `tool: Reading 1 file… (ctrl+o to expand)` with the command on following rows (`$ printf …`); the final frame collapses it to `Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)`. A content row can start with `$ `: only the cursor row may be treated as the prompt.
6. **Turn end.** `ESC]133;C`, `ESC]133;D` and `BEL` arrive together, immediately **before** the final frame with the reply. Announcements wait for the frame (FR-7.2).
7. **Titles.** `ESC]0;…` carries a state glyph and the session name: `◐ Basic arithmetic question` while working, `✳ …` idle.
8. **Bracketed paste marks text as pasted.** Claude answered that an instruction "came from the pasted text rather than from you directly" and did not follow it. The user's words go as typed text (FR-2.5).
9. **Turn summary lines.** `Crunched for 5s · done 2:48 PM`.
10. **Exit.** `/exit` opened the autocomplete list below the prompt, `\r` ran it: marks, `BEL`, mode resets, title cleared, `Resume this session with:` and `claude --resume <id>`, exit.
11. Tip rows appear inside the dynamic block while working and vanish with the final frame; `effort: xhigh · /effort` sits in the block for the first turns.
12. **240 columns behave the same** (`conversation-claude2.1.277-240x50.vt`); a y/n dialog echoes the typed `y` with a backspace-space-`y` sequence before the redraw.
13. **A message sent while Claude works** (`steering-claude2.1.278-240x50.vt`): drawn inside the dynamic block as `you: <text>` over `ctrl+x ctrl+s to send now`, redrawn with the spinner every second on shifting rows (a running Bash tool shows `Running…  (3s · timeout 1m)` and `(ctrl+b to run in background)` above it). When Claude takes it up, the `you:` row stays where it was drawn last, the hint disappears and the reply follows. There is no second echo. FR-4.7 is the rule that came out of it.
14. **A lone `\n` write is Ctrl+J**: a two-line draft, a two-row echo, and a reply that treats it as typed text, not a paste.
15. **The draft is printed without a frame bracket** (`long-message-claude2.1.278-240x50.vt`): `$ ` plus the text, wrapped over several rows, no cursor hide/show, so the app sees it only at a quiet-timer frame end. The echo wraps the same way.
16. **Mode cycling** (smoke recording): `ESC[Z` went from `auto mode on (shift+tab to cycle)` to `manual mode on` (no cycle hint) to `accept edits on (shift+tab to cycle)`. Each change prints `[manual mode on]` on the row under the prompt for one frame with the cursor parked on it. These bracketed rows are Claude's own announcements and the app speaks them.
17. **Ctrl+O** (smoke recordings): after a turn, two presses drew nothing: screen reader mode never re-renders printed rows, so a past tool summary cannot be expanded. On an idle prompt, Ctrl+O replaced the mode line and the prompt with `Showing detailed transcript · ctrl+o to toggle · ctrl+e to show all verbose`, and a message typed afterwards was never taken up. Ctrl+O is a mode switch that hides the prompt, not an expander.
18. **`--verbose`** (smoke recording, 2.1.278, 2026-09-19): started with `--ax-screen-reader --verbose`, Claude prints what the tools return in full and no `(ctrl+o to expand)` summary at all: `tool: Bash (echo alpha && echo beta && echo gamma)` followed by the rows `alpha`, `beta`, `gamma`; `tool: Read`, rewritten in place to `tool: Read(C:\…\notes.txt)`, followed by `Read 4 lines`; then `claude: OK DONE`. The output rows are unlabelled rows after the `tool:` row, up to the next labelled row. This is the working form of the "show all verbose" that Ctrl+O's status row advertises, and the material a fold of tool output under its `tool:` line would work on.
19. **Ctrl+O while Claude works** (smoke recording, 2.1.278, 2026-09-19: two exchanges, then a 15 s Bash tool): the first press moved the cursor up to the row of the first `claude:` reply on screen and redrew everything from there as the detailed transcript (`12:26 PM claude-fable-5-1`, then the `transcript · ctrl+o to toggle · ctrl+e to show all verbose` status); the second press redrew the plain conversation from the same row, `claude: hello` and `claude: again` printed for the third time. Rows above kept their place. For the app that is old lines with new text and new lines with old text: the transcript doubles and Speak replies reads old replies again, which is what was heard. Hence D14.
20. **A repaint from the top in a long session** (a raw recording from the app, 2.1.281, 2026-09-24; not committed, it holds personal paths): after a tool row had turned into `tool error:`, Claude sent `ESC[?25l` eleven times and then `ESC[H`, with no erase, and printed the whole conversation again from the top row as a burst of frames that scrolled the screen: earlier turns reaching back before the recording, Claude's messages reworded in places. The app took the rewritten rows for edits of the lines on screen and the scrolled rows for new lines, so the conversation gained a copy and Speak replies read old turns again, over "Done". A frame starts at the first row of the live block, below the conversation, and Claude erases the screen before it starts afresh, so `ESC[H` with no erase since the last frame and a visible line on the top row is a repaint (`SessionModel.OnHomed`): the lines on screen are let go with the text they had at the last frame end, and what the burst prints gets lines of its own, hidden as copies (`Line.RepaintHidden`) until the output goes quiet; a later frame that writes something else on such a row shows it. The trigger is not known for certain.

### 4.5 Two Windows process gotchas

1. **Standard handle inheritance.** A launcher with redirected stdio hands its pipes to the child even with `bInheritHandles = false`; Claude Code then sees no TTY and silently switches to `--print` mode. Fix: clear the three standard handles with `SetStdHandle` around `CreateProcess` (FR-1.4).
2. **Nested session variables.** A process started from inside Claude Code carries `CLAUDECODE=1` and other `CLAUDE*` variables; the child environment is built without them (FR-1.3).

## 5. Functional requirements

MUST unless marked SHOULD; everything listed is built.

### FR-1 Launch and process hosting

- FR-1.1: Create a ConPTY of a fixed size (default 240×50, settings `ptyColumns` / `ptyRows`) and start `claude.exe --ax-screen-reader` in the project folder with the extra arguments from the command line.
- FR-1.2: Locate `claude`: an explicit path (`--claude <path>`, else the `claudePath` setting) is the only place tried; without one, `claude.exe`/`claude.cmd` in every `PATH` folder, then `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin\claude.exe`, then `%APPDATA%\npm\claude.cmd`. A `.cmd` shim runs through `cmd.exe /d /s /c`. Nothing found: the notice of FR-1.9, the window stays open.
- FR-1.3: The child environment is the current environment minus every `CLAUDE*` variable, plus `TERM=xterm-256color`, `CLAUDE_AX_STARTUP_QUIET_MS=0`, `CLAUDE_AX_PREPARK_MS=0`, `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ALTERNATE_SCREEN=1`.
- FR-1.4: Clear the app's own standard handles around `CreateProcess` (§4.5).
- FR-1.5: Console output is read on a background thread and handed to the UI thread in batches (§7.3); never read on the UI thread. Writes go through one serialized writer.
- FR-1.6: When Claude exits: the system line `Claude stopped (exit code N). Press Ctrl+Shift+R to start it again.`, the announcement `Claude stopped`, status `stopped`. No auto-restart.
- FR-1.7: On close, close the pseudo console (Claude exits), wait up to 2 s, then terminate. No Ctrl+C. Claude Code persists the conversation continuously, so `--continue` recovers it. A close (Alt+F4, the close button, Project → Exit) while Claude is in the middle of a turn (working, waiting for an answer, or holding a message sent while it worked) first shows the **Close AxClaude?** notice (D23): "Claude is still working" (or "Claude is waiting for your answer"; plus " and a message you sent is still waiting for it" when one is), ". If you close now, Claude stops in the middle of its work.", "What is done so far is saved. Start AxClaude again to carry on.", and the key line "Enter: Close anyway. Escape: Keep working." (D23) Buttons **Close anyway** (Enter) and **Keep working** (Escape). The same notice comes up while Claude runs work in the background after its turn (a shell started with `run_in_background`), which the mode line counts as `auto mode on  ·  1 shell  ·  ↓ to manage` (`SessionModel.Background`, kept while a screen of Claude's covers the mode line): "Claude has work running in the background (1 shell). If you close now, the background work stops." (appended as ", and it has work running in the background (1 shell)" when Claude is also in a turn). The New session notice warns the same way (FR-8.6), and the status bar shows `1 shell in the background`. An idle Claude with nothing in the background closes at once; a Windows shutdown or Task Manager never asks.
- FR-1.8 SHOULD: **Force Claude to restart** (Ctrl+Shift+R, announced "Restarting") stops and restarts in the same folder with the same arguments. While Claude runs it first shows the **Force Claude to restart?** notice (D23): "Claude is still working." or "Claude is waiting for your answer." while in a turn, "Claude has work running in the background (1 shell)." while background work runs (FR-1.7), then "Restarting immediately quits Claude Code and terminates any processes it runs in the background, then starts it again in the same folder with the same options. The conversation stays in the window." and the key line "Enter: Restart now. Escape: Keep Claude running." (D23); buttons **Restart now** (Enter) and **Keep Claude running** (Escape). A stopped Claude starts at once. The arguments are those after `--` on the command line (FR-9.1) or the ones chosen last in the New session notice (FR-8.6). No resume menu item: `--continue` is the default (FR-9.1); `--resume <id>` and the like go after `--` or through New session, and Restart keeps them. Restart keeps the conversation in the window, and a restart with `--continue` in the same folder shows no replay (FR-4.8); New session and a folder change clear the conversation (FR-8.3, FR-8.6).
- FR-1.9 SHOULD: When Claude Code is not found, the notice **Claude Code was not found** (D23) lists the paths tried, gives the install command `irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex` with **Copy install command** (the notice stays; "Copied. Paste it into PowerShell" is spoken), **Open install instructions** (`https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup`), **Locate claude.exe…** (the standard file picker; a choice closes the notice, is saved as `claudePath` and started at once; Cancel returns to the notice) and **Close** (Enter or Escape). A system line says the same; Restart retries after an install.
- FR-1.10 SHOULD: **Updates.** Releases are GitHub releases of `KyleKeane/AxClaude`, each with the zip that `publish.ps1` builds (§9, D25). At startup, when `checkForUpdates` is on (the default; Options → Check for updates when AxClaude starts), the app asks the GitHub API once for the latest release, off the UI thread with a 30 s limit; a failure only goes to the log. A version above the running one (major, minor, build) is written as a system line and the update notice opens at once, unless another notice is open, in which case it is announced ("Update 1.0.1 in the Help menu"). Help always shows **Installed: AxClaude 1.0.0** (opens About), **Latest release: AxClaude 1.0.1 (newer than this one)** (opens the release page; before a result the item reads *not checked yet*, *checking…*, *none published yet* or *unknown, GitHub could not be reached*, and choosing it checks) and **Update to AxClaude 1.0.1…**; without a newer release the last item reads **Check for updates…**, asks on demand and reports in a notice: the newest version is in use, or GitHub could not be reached (with **Open releases page**). The update notice shows the release notes (the CHANGELOG section) with **Update now**, **Open release page** and **Later**. Update now downloads the zip into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Axit\updates\<version>` and extracts it (announced: "Downloading AxClaude 1.0.1", then "Downloaded. Restarting to update"), then closes the window; the close question of FR-1.7 applies, and Keep working cancels the install and keeps the download. On the way out the app starts that version's own `install.ps1 -WaitForProcess <pid> -Start <folder> [-ContinueConversation] -LogFile %LOCALAPPDATA%\Axit\logs\update.log` without a window: it waits for this process to end, installs over `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Axit` and starts the new AxClaude on the same folder, with `-- --continue` when a message was sent in the session. Nothing is downloaded or installed without the user choosing it.

### FR-2 Input

- FR-2.1: A multi-line field "Message to Claude", three lines high, at the bottom. **Enter** sends and clears it; **Shift+Enter** inserts a line break (D11). Enter on an empty field sends a bare Enter (confirms dialogs). **Page Up / Page Down** move the caret one screen of the field's rows up or down, or to its first / last row when less than a screen is left, the same code as the conversation's (`EditPaging`): the control's own keys do nothing while the message fits its rows and never reach the ends. Home, End, Ctrl+Home and Ctrl+End are native: the start or end of the row, or of the message. NVDA reads the row the caret lands on; the app says nothing. While Claude is not running, Enter sends nothing, keeps the text and announces "Claude stopped. Ctrl+Shift+R starts it".
- FR-2.2: The text is one write, then `\r` as a **separate** write 100 ms later (§4.4 item 1).
- FR-2.3: **Shift+Escape**, anywhere, sends `ESC` (interrupt / close a dialog); Session → Interrupt Claude does the same. Plain Escape in the input field sends nothing and announces "Shift+Escape interrupts", interrupting other speech (D20). Ctrl+Escape opens the Start menu before any app sees it. Neither key clears the field.
- FR-2.4: Ctrl+Up / Ctrl+Down in the field send Up / Down to Claude (its menus). Claude's own history recall lands on the hidden prompt row, so it is not usable through the app.
- FR-2.5: A multi-line message goes as typed text: each line as its own write, a single `\n` write between lines (Ctrl+J), then `\r`. Bracketed paste is **not** used for the user's own words (§4.4 items 8 and 14).
- FR-2.6: Plain Up and Down in the field only move the caret; the field has no history of its own (D13). Earlier messages are in the conversation (`i` / Shift+I, FR-5), and Enter on a line copies it back into the field (FR-2.9).
- FR-2.7: Ctrl+Shift+M (Session → Send Shift+Tab) sends Shift+Tab to Claude, the next permission mode, from anywhere in the window; the new mode is announced (FR-7.7). Tab and Shift+Tab are focus keys (FR-6.3, D35).
- FR-2.8: Sending is never locked while Claude works: Claude Code queues or steers with the message itself (§4.4 item 13). The app announces "Queued" instead of "Sent" and prints the exchange block when Claude takes the message up (FR-4.7). Session → **Send the waiting message now** (Ctrl+Shift+S) writes Claude's Ctrl+X Ctrl+S as two writes, so Claude takes the message up at once instead of after its current step; announced "Sending now", or "Nothing queued" when the status shows none.
- FR-2.9: Enter on a conversation line quotes it in the field: a blank line when the field is not empty, the literal line `_ start of copied line from conversation history _`, then `Line 3 of 54:` (the display line number and count as `l` reports them), then the line's text on a line of its own (joined rows as one), then the literal line `_ start of comment on the copied line _`, then a new line where the field's caret goes. Announces "Line 3 copied" and moves the focus into the field, so the comment can be typed at once; the conversation caret stays where it was, and Ctrl+2 returns to it (D21).
- FR-2.10: **Nothing typed goes into a question by mistake** (D33). While a question shows in the control area, the message field is not there at all. When Claude waits for an answer with the field in place (a panel's list, a question the app cannot read, the moment before the area shows it), Enter sends only an answer: one of the question's keys (`y`, `n`, a number of its list), several keys separated by commas when it takes several, any text while Claude shows an `Enter text for` row (its own words after Other), or, when the question could not be read, `y`, `n` or a number; an answer goes one keystroke per character, then Enter, and an empty field sends Enter as always. Any other text stays in the field and "Not sent, Claude asks: <title>. Enter again sends" is spoken; Enter again with the same text sends it as a message, the way out when a wait is misread. Text sent into a question used to be lost: Claude answers "Please answer y or n." and drops it, and in a list a letter can be a key of the screen.
- Dropped: a paste-as-pasted-text command, a persisted per-project history, an `@` file picker (Claude Code covers them); the field's own history recall on Up and Down (1.0.0 to 1.0.2, D13).

### FR-3 Transcript view

- FR-3.1: A read-only, multi-line, word-wrapped text view "Conversation" fills the window above the field: a native Win32 EDIT control (WinForms `TextBox`), so NVDA reads it line by line and supports review, selection and copying.
- FR-3.2: Each transcript line is one logical line of Claude's output or one app line. Trailing whitespace is trimmed. Rows the terminal soft-wrapped are not joined: at 240 columns Claude hard-wraps first, see FR-3.2a.
- FR-3.2a SHOULD: A plain row inside a `claude:` or `you:` block that follows a row within 20 characters of the console width, and starts with a space or a lowercase letter, is `JoinedToPrevious`; the view shows the two as one line joined with a space (none when the row starts with one). Rows under a `tool:` line, labelled rows, blank rows and rows at a marker never join; a joined row is never a heading; `l` counts a joined line once. The model keeps the rows as separate `Line`s; only the mirror's separator changes (D17). Setting `joinWrappedLines` (default true, file only) turns it off.
- FR-3.3: Output that arrives while the user reads never moves the caret or selection, never scrolls the view away from the caret, never makes NVDA speak. Without focus, the caret tracks the end and the view scrolls to it, so Ctrl+Tab lands on the newest line; the view also scrolls to the caret when it gains focus. A notice opened while the view had focus does not count as losing it (`KeepCaret`). The caret stays on its transcript line and column while lines above change, its own line is rewritten, or lines are hidden or trimmed (§7.7). Output within 250 ms of a key press in the focused view is applied once the keys stop.
- FR-3.4: A screen row keeps its line while it is on screen, so in-place rewrites update the line. A line is committed once its row scrolls off or the screen is reset.
- FR-3.5: Chrome is hidden, decided at frame end (§7.5): (a) every row **below** the cursor row; (b) the cursor row when it is the prompt or the draft, or the mode line (on a full screen Claude can park the cursor on the mode line in the bottom row while it works, and the spinner and mode line above a non-chrome cursor row were spoken with the reply); (c) the contiguous block above the cursor row that matches the chrome patterns in `LineClassifier` (mode line, spinner, `Tip:`, `ctrl+g to edit in Notepad`, `effort: … · /effort`, the queued-message hint, the background hint, a bracketed announcement, the completion list). Content rows outside that block are never matched, so `$ printf …` in a reply stays. The mode line and the spinner feed the status bar. No option shows hidden rows; Options → Record raw stream captures the stream for diagnosis.
- FR-3.6: At most `maxTranscriptLines` (default 20 000) lines; beyond that the oldest 10 % that are off screen are dropped in one operation and the view keeps the caret on its line.
- FR-3.7 SHOULD: Ctrl+F (anywhere; Navigate → Find…) opens the **Find** notice (D23): a "Text to find" field with the last text selected, **Find next** (Enter) and **Cancel** (Escape); Enter with an empty field keeps the notice open and announces "Type the text to find". F3 / Shift+F3 repeat the search; with no text yet they open the notice. Case-insensitive, line by line from the line after (before) the caret, wrapping, ending with the caret line. A match focuses the conversation, puts the caret at it and announces the line, prefixed "From the top, " or "From the end, " after a wrap; no match announces "Not found: <text>" and leaves the caret.
- FR-3.8 SHOULD: Project → **Save conversation as…** (Ctrl+S) writes the conversation as shown (hidden rows left out, wrapped rows joined) as UTF-8 without a byte order mark, default name `axclaude-<folder>-<yyyyMMdd-HHmm>.txt` in the Documents folder, outside the project (D34); announces "Saved".
- FR-3.9: **Bookmarks.** `m` in the conversation (Navigate → Bookmark this line; Ctrl+Shift+K from anywhere, which focuses the conversation first) drops a bookmark in front of the caret's line: an app line `Bookmark n` (`LineKind.Bookmark`, `IsMarker`: never classified or hidden, not a heading; *n* counts bookmarks since the session started), announced "Bookmark n added"; the caret stays. On a bookmarked line, or on the bookmark line itself, `m` removes it ("Bookmark n removed"). `k` / Shift+K jump to the next / previous bookmark line and announce it together with the line it marks ("Bookmark 2, claude: …"); otherwise "No next bookmark". A bookmark on a wrapped line (FR-3.2a) goes in front of its first row and leaves the join and the heading rule around it alone (`JoinWrappedRows` steps over bookmark lines). Bookmarks are conversation lines: they are copied and saved with it (FR-3.8), trimmed with it (FR-3.6), and live as long as the conversation in the window. Nothing is persisted separately.
- FR-3.10: **Reading breaks.** When the view has the focus and the caret is on the last screen row of the text, the reader has heard everything there is, so the view marks the end of the last line as heard when output is applied; what Claude appends to that line (or joins to it) after the mark is rendered on a line of its own, so that Down Arrow reads only what is new (D28). A mark that would cut a word moves in front of the word (never in front of the caret), and a space after the mark stays on the heard side. The breaks are rendering only: `l`, Enter, Find and Ctrl+S see the joined line. They are removed, and the line joined up again, once the caret has left the display line that holds them or the view has lost the focus.
- FR-3.11: **Selection.** Shift with the arrow keys, Ctrl+Shift+End and Ctrl+A select text natively. While the focused view holds a selection, output waits (as after a key press) until the selection is gone, so the selected text never changes under the reader. Ctrl+C with a selection copies it and announces `Copied` (`Could not copy. Try again` when the clipboard is held). Escape with a selection clears it, puts the caret at its start and announces `Selection cleared`; Escape without a selection focuses the message field as before.
- FR-3.12: **Jump history.** Before every jump the app makes (the quick keys, `k`, Ctrl+Shift+O, find, Page Up / Page Down) the caret's line is remembered, up to the last 100. Backspace goes back to the most recent one and announces `Back to <line>`; each press goes one jump further back. A remembered line that is no longer shown is skipped; with nothing left, `Nothing to go back to`. Arrow keys and Ctrl+Home / Ctrl+End are native and not remembered; going back is itself not remembered.
- FR-3.13: Options → Font… (the Windows font dialog); Ctrl+Plus / Ctrl+Minus change the size in 1-point steps (6 to 72) and announce it; "Use the Windows text size" returns to the system message font, which follows the text size slider under Settings → Accessibility. Menus and the status bar use the system font. Colours are the system colours, so high contrast themes apply.
- Dropped: a transcript log file (Claude Code keeps every conversation).

### FR-4 Markers

- FR-4.1: When the user sends a message, the app prints an **exchange block** at the end of the conversation, above the trailing chrome block: `# Input n`, the message as sent (one line per line, trailing whitespace trimmed), a blank line, `# Output n Reply from Claude`, a blank line. *n* counts messages since the app started, or since New session cleared the conversation (FR-8.6); a replayed conversation has its own count (FR-4.8). Nothing in the block moves afterwards; the reply follows it (D22). The `#` is literal, so a saved conversation is Markdown. Both markers are level 1 headings; Claude's headings are level 2 and deeper. The message lines and blank lines are app lines (`LineKind.UserMessage`), never classified or hidden. A message sent while Claude works gets its block later (FR-4.7). FR-4.6 adds a time stamp.
- FR-4.2: Claude's `you:` echo is hidden, always. The echo block is found by text: from the `you:` row, rows are taken while the text so far, whitespace removed, is a prefix of the sent text, whitespace removed, until equal. Wrapped rows and blank lines inside the message belong to the echo; the rows after it do not.
- FR-4.3: An echo that does not repeat the sent text (a `[Pasted text #1 +5 lines]` placeholder) stays visible after the block.
- FR-4.4: No block for a bare Enter, special keys, slash commands (no echo; their output follows the previous lines) or an answer typed while a prompt waits (Claude's cursor sits on a prompt row, FR-7.2).
- FR-4.5: App system lines read `System: <message>`.
- FR-4.6 SHOULD: Options → **Show the time in the Input and Output lines** (setting `markerTimeStamps`, default off): `# Input 3 (14:32)` and `# Output 3 Reply from Claude (14:32)`, 24-hour. Existing markers keep their text.
- FR-4.7: A message sent while Claude works is drawn by Claude **inside** the working block over the `ctrl+x ctrl+s to send now` hint (§4.4 item 13); those rows are chrome, never the echo. The message is held outside the conversation until the hint disappears and the `you:` block becomes content, which is when Claude takes it up; the block then goes in directly before that echo, and the echo is hidden, so the message and its response arrive together (D16). Meanwhile the status bar shows `1 message waiting`. If Claude becomes idle with nothing waiting and no echo came, the block goes in at the end. A pending send is matched to an echo by its text (an echo that repeats nothing is left alone, since a `you:` row quoted in a tool result, replayed at startup or printed for a slash command is not the message, and a held block whose echo never comes goes in once Claude is idle), lives for 30 minutes.
- FR-4.8: **Replayed conversation.** With `--continue` or `--resume` Claude prints the earlier exchanges at startup as plain `you:` and `claude:` rows. Once Claude is ready (FR-7.7), the app puts the exchange block around each of them: `# Input n from previous session` before the `you:` rows, which stay as the message with their label, then a blank line, `# Output n from previous session Reply from Claude` and a blank line before the first `claude:`, `thinking:` or `tool:` row that follows. *n* counts from 1 in replay order; the live numbering is separate and starts at 1 for every run of the app (FR-4.1), the label telling the two apart. A slash command (`you: /exit`) gets no block. The last past output marker counts as a response already started, so the replay never announces "Responding" (FR-7.7). Rows of an earlier run in the same window keep the blocks they got then: a restart remembers the last line before it, and only the rows after it are looked at (a text match would be fooled by a quoted `[Screen Reader Mode:` row). `i` does not stop on a `you:` row that has a marker in front of it (§6.4). A restart in the folder Claude was already running in, with `--continue` in effect (Restart Claude), replays the conversation the window already shows: every row Claude prints is hidden until Claude is ready, so the window keeps its conversation and the live numbering goes on with no copy underneath. A question (trust, a prompt) or an exit before Claude is ready shows the hidden rows after all. A folder change (FR-8.3, FR-8.5) and New session (FR-8.6) clear the window first and show the replay with its blocks, as at the first start of the app. The mode and session name of the run that ended are forgotten at every restart: the status says `starting` until the new Claude prints its mode line, which is also what marks it ready (FR-7.7).

### FR-5 Navigation keys in the transcript view

Single keys act only when the view has focus and no modifier other than Shift is held. Shift reverses direction. Each jump moves the caret to the start of the target line, scrolls it into view and announces its text (FR-7). No target: "No next input", "No previous heading", and so on; the caret stays.

| Key | Target |
| :-- | :-- |
| `i` / Shift+I | input marker (`# Input n`, `# Input n from previous session`), or a `you:` row that has none |
| `o` / Shift+O, `r` / Shift+R | output marker (`# Output n Reply from Claude`); `r` is an alias (r for reply) |
| `h` / Shift+H | heading: the markers (level 1) and Claude's headings (level 2 and deeper, §7.6) |
| `1`…`6` / Shift | heading of that level |
| `c` / Shift+C | `claude:` reply line |
| `t` / Shift+T | tool line: `tool:`, `tool error:` or a summary ending in `(ctrl+o to expand)` |
| `d` / Shift+D | turn summary (`… for 5s · done 2:48 PM`), d for done |
| `p` / Shift+P | paragraph: the first line, or a line with text directly after a blank line |
| `e` / Shift+E | `error:`, `warning:` or `tool error:` |
| `s` / Shift+S | system line |
| `q` / Shift+Q | the record of a question Claude asked, `Question: <title>` (D33) |
| `k` / Shift+K | bookmark line (`Bookmark n`, FR-3.9); the announcement adds the line it marks |
| `m` | bookmark this line, or remove its bookmark (FR-3.9); the caret stays |
| Backspace | back to the line the caret left at the last jump, one jump per press (FR-3.12) |
| Ctrl+Shift+O | latest output marker, from anywhere; "No response yet" when none |
| Ctrl+Shift+K | bookmark the caret's line, from anywhere (focuses the conversation) |
| Page Up / Page Down | one screen of wrapped rows up / down from the caret, keeping the caret's screen row, or the first / last row when less than a screen is left (`EditPaging`, shared with the message field, FR-2.1). The native keys work from the visible page, strand a caret that is scrolled out of view and never reach the ends. NVDA reads the new row; the app says nothing. Shift+Page Up/Down stay native. |
| `l` | `Line 12 of 340` (joined rows count once); the caret stays. On demand only: arrow movement never speaks line numbers. |
| Ctrl+F, F3 / Shift+F3 | find (FR-3.7), from anywhere |
| Home / End, Ctrl+Home / Ctrl+End | start / end of the row, of the text (native) |
| Enter | quote the line in the message field (FR-2.9) |
| Escape | clear the selection when there is one (FR-3.11), else focus the input field (nothing is sent) |
| Ctrl+C | copy the selection, `Copied` (FR-3.11) |
| Shift+Escape | send Escape to Claude (FR-2.3) |

The key table is data (`QuickKey(Keys, Name, Matches, Previous)` in `TranscriptView`, `Previous` being a condition on the line before the target); the keys are fixed in code.

### FR-6 Focus

- FR-6.1: Tab, Shift+Tab, Ctrl+Tab, Ctrl+Shift+Tab and F6 toggle between the field and the view from anywhere.
- FR-6.2: Focus starts in the field and stays there after sending.
- FR-6.3: Tab and Shift+Tab move between the view and the control at the bottom (the field, or the control area in its place), as Ctrl+Tab and F6 do (D35).
- FR-6.4: Alt opens the menu bar; every item has a mnemonic and, where applicable, a displayed shortcut.
- FR-6.5: Ctrl+1 focuses the field and Ctrl+2 the view, from anywhere (Navigate → Go to message field / Go to conversation). When the control has the focus already, its accessible name (`Message to Claude`, `Conversation`) is announced instead, so the key also tells the user where they are (D26). A focus change is announced by NVDA itself; the app adds nothing then.

### FR-7 Announcements and attention signals

- FR-7.1: Announcements are UI Automation notifications raised on the transcript view (`RaiseAutomationNotification`), which NVDA speaks without moving focus; while a notice shows they are raised on the notice's text or field. Jump results use "most recent" processing (a new jump cancels the previous); status announcements use "all".
- FR-7.2: The bell (BEL) starts or restarts a 400 ms timer, because the bell arrives just before the final frame (§4.4 item 6). When it fires: **"Claude asks"** if Claude's cursor sits on a prompt row (`Permission Required:`, `Enter selection`, `Enter y/n`, `Select with numbers`) or on the blank row under one, otherwise **"Done"** (setting `announceBell`, default on). Only the cursor row counts: a tool result or a replay can quote a prompt anywhere else (§4.4). Rows that scroll away inside one frame are classified when they are committed, so a replay's `you:` and `claude:` rows keep their kinds.
- FR-7.3: **Chimes** (`soundOnBell`, default on; Options → Play sounds: ready, sent, replying, done, question): a single high ping (C6) with "Ready"; a single low note (A4) with "Sent", "Queued" and "Sent"; three rising notes ending on a long one (C5, E5, G5) with "Responding"; the same notes falling (G5, E5, C5) with "Done"; two equal notes (E5, E5) with "Claude asks". No chime hangs on the working status: the bell comes once per turn (§4.4 item 6), so the done chime marks the end of the whole turn. With the bell also, when the window is not active, a taskbar flash until it is activated (`flashTaskbar`, default on). NVDA speaks notifications only from the active window, so these reach a user working elsewhere. The sounds are short sine tones generated in code (`WaveTone`) and played through one winmm wave-out device that stays open (`Sounds`, D31); no media file ships.
- FR-7.4: **Speak replies as they arrive** (`replySpeech`: `none` (default), `firstLines`, `all`; Options → Speak replies as they arrive → **None** | **First lines only** | **All lines**, shown checked like a radio group; a choice announces `Speak replies: <the item>` and takes effect with what arrives next). Reply lines after the newest output marker are spoken once final: committed, followed by another visible line, or Claude idle. A line whose text was already spoken since that marker is not spoken again: in a long turn Claude can print lines it printed before as new rows, and the first reply of the turn was read out again as the turn ended, over "Done"; such reprints are Claude repainting from the top (§4.4 item 20), and this rule is the second line of defence. *All lines* speaks the `claude:` line and its unlabelled continuation lines; *First lines only* speaks the `claude:` line of each message, where Claude says what it is doing or what it found, and leaves the rest for reading, which gives the major moments of a long turn without its detail. **Speak each tool call** (`speakToolCalls`, default off; Options → Speak each tool call, a check item) adds the `tool:` row of each call, as printed (`tool: Bash (sleep 20)`, `tool: Reading 1 file…`) less a trailing `(ctrl+o to expand)` hint, whatever the reply mode, None included; it is spoken as soon as it arrives, since the row is printed whole and the tool's running status is drawn under it, and it joins the utterance of any reply line that became final in the same frame. A collapsed row that Claude rewrites in place for the next call (`tool: Reading 2 files…`) is spoken again with its new text; its summary once the calls are done (`Read 2 files (ctrl+o to expand)`) is not. Tool output, thinking and the `you:` rows are never auto-spoken, nor is the conversation replayed at startup: speech starts once Claude is ready (FR-7.7). The lines that become final in one frame go out as **one** notification (D32): a wrapped continuation joins with a space, other lines with a full stop unless they end with punctuation of their own, so a heading or a list item is heard as a unit. A line counts as spoken by identity and text: Claude redraws rows in place, and the row that held the prompt a moment ago holds the first reply line next. The pass behind this is shared with the tick (FR-7.8): `Arrivals` in Core, one walk over the transcript per frame.
- FR-7.5: System events are announced: folder changed, Restart Claude, Claude stopped, copy confirmations, recording started and stopped, text size changes, "No next …", find results, "Saved".
- FR-7.6: If notifications are unavailable (the call returns false), the target line is selected so NVDA reads "selected …".
- FR-7.7: Sending announces "Sent", or "Queued" while Claude works, or "Sent" when a prompt waited. "Responding" is announced once per output marker when the first reply, thinking or tool line appears after it. Claude's own bracketed announcements (`[accept edits on]`, §4.4 item 16) are spoken as they appear; that confirms a mode change (Ctrl+Shift+M). "Ready" once per start, with its ping (FR-7.3), when the first mode line appears with Claude idle; the replayed conversation is marked at that moment (FR-4.8) and announces nothing else.
- FR-7.8: **Tick** (`clickOnNewLine`, default on; Options → Tick for each new line and tool call from Claude, one item for both ticks): a 10 ms typewriter-like strike (a burst of noise over a 1.5 kHz tone that dies away, with a short attack so it is one tick and not a click) whenever a frame adds a visible line from Claude to the conversation (any line that is not one of the app's own: the markers, the message, system lines, bookmarks). A frame that brings a tool call row (a `tool:` row that is new, or a collapsed one rewritten for the next call, as the tool call speech of FR-7.4 sees it) plays the **tool tick** in its place: two lower knocks in a row, 12 ms each and rising, so that a tool starting is told from a line arriving without a word. A frame that adds several lines ticks once. The ticks play whatever the speech mode (FR-7.4) and whether or not NVDA is speaking. A tick never cuts a chime short: it is queued behind the chime, and a tick is dropped while the previous one has not played yet, so ticks never pile up (D31); a chime replaces a tick.

### FR-8 Project folder

- FR-8.1: The folder is chosen in this order: positional argument or `--project`; the current directory unless it is the app's own; the last folder from settings; otherwise the folder picker before Claude starts.
- FR-8.2: Project → **Open current folder: C:\path** (Ctrl+W) shows the full path; activating it opens the folder in the default file manager, one of the system's own windows (D23). With no folder chosen it announces `No project folder`; when the folder is gone, `Folder missing`; a failure to start the file manager is reported like a page that could not be opened. (Until 1.1 the item copied the path.)
- FR-8.3: Project → **Change folder…** (menu only: Ctrl+N is New session, FR-8.6, and Ctrl+O is guarded, D14) opens the standard folder picker (`FolderBrowserDialog`, path typeable), then clears the conversation and restarts Claude there with the same arguments: the system line `System: Project folder changed to C:\path` is the first line of the emptied window, what Claude prints in the folder follows (its earlier conversation with the `from previous session` blocks when it has one, FR-4.8), and the announcement is "Folder <name>". Another folder is another conversation, so nothing of the old one stays, as for New session (FR-8.6); Restart Claude keeps it (FR-1.8).
- FR-8.4: The folder name is in the title (`<name> - AxClaude`) and the full path in the status bar.
- FR-8.5: Project → **Recent folders** lists the last 10 that still exist; choosing one clears the conversation and restarts Claude there, as FR-8.3.
- FR-8.6: Project → **New session…** (Ctrl+N) opens the **New Claude session** notice (D23, D30). Its text starts with `Folder: C:\path` (`(none chosen yet)` when there is none), then "Choose how Claude starts. Starting stops the current session and starts a new one in the folder." and the key line "Enter: Start session. Escape: Cancel." (D23), preceded by "Claude is still working. A new session stops it in the middle of its work." while Claude is busy (as in FR-1.7). Under the text: the **Choose folder…** button (the folder picker; the chosen folder replaces the first line, is announced as `Folder: C:\path`, and the notice stays open), the group **How Claude starts** with the radio buttons **New conversation** (no arguments), **Continue the last conversation** (`--continue`), **Choose a conversation to resume** (`--resume`), **New conversation in plan mode** (`--permission-mode plan`), **New conversation, edits accepted without asking** (`--permission-mode acceptEdits`) and **Custom**, and, while Custom is selected, the multi-line field **Custom arguments** (Enter starts, Shift+Enter is a new line). The preset whose arguments are the current ones is selected (Continue the last conversation at first, the default of FR-9.1), otherwise Custom holding them as one line. Buttons **Start session** (Enter) and **Cancel** (Escape). Start without a folder announces "Choose a folder first" and stays. Start splits the Custom text at whitespace (a double-quoted part keeps its spaces, `\"` is a literal quote; `ClaudeLauncher.SplitArguments`), keeps the arguments for Restart (FR-1.8), **clears the conversation** and relaunches Claude in the folder with `--ax-screen-reader` followed by them: the system line `New session in C:\path with --continue` (or `with no extra arguments`) is the first line of the emptied window, and the announcement is "New session in <name>". A new session is a new conversation, or a resumed one, so nothing of the old one stays above it: every line goes, a message held for its echo (FR-4.7) with it, the exchange blocks and bookmarks count from 1 again, and what the new Claude prints arrives as at the first start of the app, a replay with its `from previous session` blocks included (FR-4.8). Restart Claude keeps the conversation (FR-1.8). The arguments are not persisted (D30). Some arguments end Claude at once (print mode, an unknown flag): Claude's usual exit line follows (FR-1.6).
- FR-8.7 SHOULD: `install.ps1`, the bundle's installer (docs/axit/SPEC.md AX-2), registers **Open in AxClaude** in the right-click menu of folders and of a folder's background (`HKCU\Software\Classes\Directory\shell\AxClaude` and `Directory\Background\shell\AxClaude`, commands `"AxClaude.exe" "%1"` and `"%V"`), a Start menu shortcut and the `axclaude` shim; `-Uninstall` removes them and the program folder. Per user, no administrator rights.

### FR-9 Command line

```
Axit.exe claude [<folder>] [--project <folder>] [--claude <path>] [--cols N] [--rows N]
                [--no-ax] [--record <file.vt>] [--] [claude arguments…]
```

AxClaude is one app of the Axit bundle (`docs/axit/SPEC.md` AX-1): `Axit.exe` reads the verb `claude`, or a folder alone, or an option alone, and hands the arguments to `AxClaudeApp.Run`; the installed console command `axclaude` stands for `Axit claude`. Everything below is what the app does with those arguments.

- FR-9.1: Everything after `--` goes to `claude` verbatim (`--resume <id>`, `--model opus`, `--permission-mode plan`). Without `--`, Claude gets `--continue`: the last conversation in the folder carries on. In a folder without one Claude prints `No conversation found to continue` and exits; the app then announces "Nothing to continue, new conversation", adds that as a system line and starts Claude again without the flag, and leaves the flag off for that folder until the folder changes. An explicit `--continue` (after `--` or from New session) gets no such rescue: Claude's own line and "Claude stopped" follow. A bare `--` gives no arguments: a new conversation.
- FR-9.2: `--no-ax` omits `--ax-screen-reader` (testing only). `--record` writes the raw stream to a file (the PtyCapture format with the `.chunks.txt` index); Options → Record raw stream for a bug report… does the same at run time. `--cols`, `--rows`, `--claude` override the settings file.
- FR-9.3: A GUI executable started from a console returns at once. `publish.ps1` builds `publish\win-x64` (the self-contained `Axit.exe`, `install.cmd`, `install.ps1`, the guide as `README.md`) and zips it as `publish\Axit-<version>-win-x64.zip`; `install.ps1` (run by `publish.ps1` unless `-NoInstall`) puts the files in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Axit`, writes the `axit.cmd` and `axclaude.cmd` shims in `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin` (on `PATH` since Claude Code's installer uses it), the Start menu entry `Axit AxClaude` and the Explorer entry, and unblocks the files so SmartScreen warns at most once.
- FR-9.4: In development: `dotnet run --project src/Axit -- claude <folder>` or `run.ps1`.
- FR-9.5 SHOULD: `--help` (`-h`, `-?`, `/?`) shows the usage in a message box; `--version` the version; a bad command line its error. These are the only message boxes: no window exists yet (D23). `Axit.exe --help` alone is the bundle's usage (AX-1.4); `Axit.exe claude --help` is this one.

### FR-10 Menus and status

The web items open `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview`, `/commands`, `/interactive-mode`, `/cli-reference` and `/setup`.

Ctrl+O is guarded (D14): the app does not send it, the key announces `Ctrl+O is off. For tool output, start with --verbose`, and the Session menu has no item for it. Should Claude's detailed view open all the same (§4.4 item 17), the app hides its status row, announces "Claude's detailed view is on. Press Ctrl+O to turn it off.", shows `detailed view on, Ctrl+O turns it off` in the status bar until the prompt is back, sends Ctrl+O once when it is pressed then, and announces "Claude's detailed view is off."

Status bar (NVDA+End): `Claude: starting | ready | working Hashing… | waiting for your answer | stopped`, then `1 message waiting` while Claude holds a message it has not taken up (FR-4.7), `1 shell in the background` while background work runs (FR-1.7), the permission mode from the mode line, the session name from the console title, and the full project path.

### FR-11 Keys sent to Claude

The Session menu and its shortcuts send raw sequences (Appendix B), fixed in code and listed in the F1 notice. Ctrl+C in the view with a selection stays "copy"; the PTY Ctrl+C is Ctrl+Shift+C.

### FR-12 Settings

- FR-12.1: `%APPDATA%\Axit\axclaude.json` (Appendix C; the first start under Axit copies AxClaude 1.x's `%APPDATA%\AxClaude\settings.json` there, docs/axit/SPEC.md AX-5.2), written atomically on change through the bundle's `SettingsFile`. A missing or invalid file falls back to the defaults with a system line saying so.
- FR-12.2: Persisted: last folder, recent folders, window placement, option toggles, font, PTY size.
- FR-12.3: Options → Open settings file opens it in the default editor.

### FR-13 Errors and diagnostics

- FR-13.1: Every failure (Claude not found, `CreatePseudoConsole` failure, process exit, settings unreadable) produces a system line and an announcement; a failure of something the user asked for (start, save, open a page or the settings file, a folder that is gone) also shows the **Error** notice (D23). Also handled plainly: a project folder that no longer exists; a Windows without a pseudo console (a sentence naming Windows 10 1809); a recording file that can no longer be written (the recording stops with a system line; the reader thread never dies); a clipboard held by another program ("Could not copy. Try again").
- FR-13.2: A rolling log `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Axit\logs\axclaude.log` records lifecycle events. The start line names the version, the executable path and the process id, so lines from an installed copy and a development build sharing the log can be told apart. The parser ignores unknown sequences silently; the raw recording is the parser diagnostic.
- FR-13.3: Help → Copy diagnostics copies versions, the executable path and process id, the other paths, the Claude state and the last 200 log lines.
- FR-13.4: An unhandled exception on the UI thread is logged and reported in the **Unexpected error** notice, which names the log file (a message box only while no window exists); the app keeps running. Background exceptions are logged.

## 6. User interface

### 6.1 Layout

Menu bar; the conversation (dock Fill); the message field (dock Bottom, three lines); the status bar. Minimum size 600×400. System font and colours throughout.

```
| Project  Session  Navigate  Options  Help                         |
| Conversation (read-only, multi-line, word wrap, vertical scroll)  |
|   # Input 1 / What is 2+2? / (blank) / # Output 1 Reply from Claude / (blank) / claude: 2 + 2 = 4 / Baked for 1s · done 2:47 PM |
| Message to Claude: [                                            ] |
| Claude: ready | manual mode on | C:\projects\myproject             |
```

A notice (D23) takes the place of the conversation and the field, between the menu bar and the status bar: a bold title, the read-only text (or, for Find, a labelled field), and a row of buttons, for example **Close AxClaude?** with **Close anyway** and **Keep working**.

### 6.2 Controls and accessible properties

| Control | Type | AccessibleName | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Transcript | `TextBox` Multiline ReadOnly WordWrap ScrollBars=Vertical AcceptsTab=false HideSelection=false MaxLength=0 | "Conversation" | NVDA: "Conversation read only edit multi line". |
| Input | `TextBox` Multiline AcceptsReturn WordWrap, three lines | "Message to Claude" | No description: it was read on every arrival (1.5.1, fewer words). Enter is handled in the field's `KeyDown`. |
| Control area | `ControlArea` in the message field's place while Claude waits: one `ListBox` (a `CheckedListBox` when a question takes several) or one single-line `TextBox`, under a `Label` showing the name | the question: "Question 1 of 2: Which colour do you prefer?" | D33. One control at a time, new for every question, so NVDA reads the name each time the focus arrives; a list box and not a `ListView`, which NVDA announced as a table; `PreviewKeyDown` makes Enter and Escape input keys; from the field's height up to half the window, the list scrolling. |
| Menu | `MenuStrip` | default | Every item has `ShortcutKeys` or `ShortcutKeyDisplayString`. |
| Status | `StatusStrip`, two `ToolStripStatusLabel`s | none: the text is what NVDA+End reads | No `Spring` (such a label is placed outside the strip and not exposed). An item that does not fit is not exposed either, so `StatusLayout` gives the labels fixed widths when the texts do not both fit: the path is clipped first, down to a quarter, then the state; NVDA reads the full text. NVDA looks for a status bar at the bottom-left pixel of the window's UI Automation rectangle, which for WinForms includes the invisible resize border; `MainForm` reports its client area plus the title bar (`MainFormAccessibleObject`, `AccessibleRole.Window`). |
| Notice | `OverlayPanel`: bold title `Label`, read-only multi-line `TextBox` named after the title, an optional labelled single-line `TextBox` ("Text to find"), the New session controls (FR-8.6), a `FlowLayoutPanel` of `Button`s with mnemonics | Keyboard shortcuts, User guide, About, Error, Unexpected error, Find, Claude Code was not found, Close AxClaude?, New Claude session, Check for updates, Update to AxClaude n | D23. The window hides the conversation and the field, disables the menu, sets `AcceptButton` / `CancelButton` to the notice's default and cancel buttons, and swallows its own shortcuts, the menu's and Alt/F10 while the notice shows; Tab cycles text, field and buttons. Focus lands in the field or at the top of the text (NVDA reads the title, the role and the first line) and returns to the control that had it unless the action moved it (Find lands in the conversation). A notice over a notice replaces it. The Windows folder, file and font pickers stay standard dialogs. |

### 6.3 Keyboard map

Global: Tab / Shift+Tab / Ctrl+Tab / Ctrl+Shift+Tab / F6 toggle field ↔ view; Ctrl+1 field, Ctrl+2 view (announced when already there); Ctrl+Shift+S send the waiting message now; Shift+Escape send ESC; Ctrl+F find, F3 / Shift+F3 next / previous; Ctrl+S save; Ctrl+W open the current folder; Ctrl+N new session; Ctrl+Shift+R restart; Ctrl+O guarded (says why, D14); Ctrl+Shift+C send Ctrl+C; Ctrl+Shift+M send Shift+Tab; Ctrl+Shift+O latest response; Ctrl+Shift+K bookmark the caret's line; Ctrl+Plus / Ctrl+Minus text size; F1 shortcuts; Alt+F4 exit; Alt menus.

Input field: Enter send; Shift+Enter new line; Escape guarded; Tab / Shift+Tab to the conversation; Ctrl+Up / Ctrl+Down send arrows; plain Up / Down move the caret only; Page Up / Page Down one screen of the field (app, FR-2.1); standard editing keys.

Control area (in the message field's place while Claude waits, D33): Up / Down move; a number or `y` / `n` jumps to its answer; Space ticks; Enter answers or sends the field's words; Escape cancels the question or goes back a step; Tab / Shift+Tab to the conversation; Ctrl+Tab / F6 / Ctrl+1 reach it as they reach the field.

Transcript view: arrows, Home/End, Ctrl+Home/Ctrl+End (native); Page Up/Down, `l` and `m` (app); Enter quote; Backspace back; Shift+arrows select (output waits while a selection exists); Ctrl+C copy (`Copied`); Ctrl+A select all; quick keys (FR-5); Escape clears a selection, else to the field.

While a notice shows: Tab / Shift+Tab between text, field and buttons; Enter the default (or focused) button; Escape the cancel button; Alt+letter a mnemonic; Ctrl+Plus / Ctrl+Minus still work; every other window and menu shortcut, and Alt or F10 alone, wait. Alt+Space and NVDA+End still work. NVDA's own commands are never intercepted.

### 6.4 Announcement texts

| A tool call, with Speak each tool call on | the `tool:` row as printed, as soon as it arrives, in the same notification as a reply line of the frame (FR-7.4) |
| Sounds | a high ping with `Ready`; a low note with `Sent`; a rising chime with `Responding`; three falling notes with `Done`; two equal notes with `Claude asks`; a tick for a frame that adds a line from Claude, two lower knocks for a frame that brings a tool call (FR-7.3, FR-7.8) |
| Copy | `Copied` / `Copied`; `Could not copy. Try again` |
| Ctrl+C in the conversation | `Copied`; `Could not copy. Try again` |
| Escape with a selection | `Selection cleared` |
| Send | `Sent` / `Queued` / `Sent`; `Sending now` / `Nothing queued` for Send now (FR-2.8) |
| Reply begins | `Responding` |
| Claude's bracketed row | its text, e.g. `accept edits on` |
| Latest response, none yet | `No response yet` |
| Text size | `Text size 14` / `Font Consolas 12 point` / `Windows text size` |
| Recording | `Recording started` / `Recording stopped` |
| A notice opens | nothing: the focus moves to its text or field and NVDA reads the title, the role and the first line |
| Claude asks (control area, D33) | the trill; the focus moves to the list, and `<question>. <the answer the focus is on>` interrupts what NVDA was reading. With Go to Claude's questions at once off: from the bottom of the window the focus moves and NVDA reads the question, the role and the answer; from the conversation `Claude asks: <question>` after what NVDA is reading |
| An answer, in the control area | `Sent: 2, Green` (after Other, `Sent: tulip`), ending `. Next question`, `. Review next` or `. Your words next` when more follows; `Cancelled`; `Saved`; `Question closed` when Claude closed it by itself; `Tick one with Space`; `Closed` when Enter on a screen's line or Escape closes the screen; `Type an answer` |
| Copy install command | `Copied. Paste it into PowerShell` |
| Update found at startup | the update notice opens, and a system line is added; `Update 1.0.1 in the Help menu` only when another notice is open |
| Update now | `Downloading AxClaude 1.0.1`; `Downloaded. Restarting to update`; Keep working: `Update not installed` |

### 7.2 Data flow

```
ConPTY output pipe ──(reader thread, one BeginInvoke per burst)──> UI thread: SessionModel.Feed = UTF-8 Decoder ──> VtParser ──> Screen
        ──(frame end: ESC[?25h, or 100 ms quiet)──> SessionModel.EndFrame (row text into lines, chrome, classification, echoes, status)
        ──Changed──> TranscriptView.Sync through TranscriptMirror (edits, caret) + announcements + status bar
Input field / menus ──> MainForm write queue (paced writes) ──> ConPTY input pipe
```

### 7.3 Threading

- Reader thread (`PtyHost`): blocking `Read`; chunks are collected in an inbox and one `BeginInvoke` per burst drains it on the UI thread, so a large output never queues hundreds of window messages ahead of the user's keys; while recording, each chunk is also written to the `.vt` file.
- UI thread: owns the parser, the screen and the `SessionModel`. A frame ends at `ESC[?25h` or after 100 ms without output; `Changed` applies the view edits with redraw suspended (`WM_SETREDRAW`) and restores the caret (§7.7).
- Writes: a queue drained on the UI thread with a delay after each write (30 ms between lines, 100 ms before `\r`).

### 7.4 PtyHost

The one ConPTY implementation: five kernel32 calls, the std-handle guard (FR-1.4), the graceful stop (FR-1.7), a reader thread and an `Exited` event from a wait thread; `ClaudeLauncher` builds the command line and the environment (FR-1.2, FR-1.3). `tools/PtyCapture` records through both, so a fixture shows what the app sees. The console size is fixed (D9).

### 7.5 VT parsing and the screen model

The stream is interpreted by a headless screen model, not stripped with regular expressions, because ConPTY expresses in-place rewrites and cursor parking with cursor movement and erase sequences. The model is deliberately small.

**Screen** = `rows × cols` cells, cursor, saved cursor, scroll region, pending-wrap flag, `Dirty` flag per row. Every row carries a stable **line identity** (a `Line` created the first time the row receives text). Scrolling moves rows up and appends a fresh row; the row that leaves the top is **committed**. Insert-line creates a row at the insertion point (its line goes before the displaced row's line) and discards the row pushed out of the region; delete-line removes the row's line. Erasing a row keeps its identity, so a cleared and overwritten dialog updates existing lines. Rows below the cursor row are not part of the transcript.

**Frames.** `ESC[?25h` ends a frame; a 100 ms quiet period also ends one. Chrome, finality and announcements are evaluated at frame end only.

Handled sequences (Appendix A): printable text with wcwidth-aware cell placement and deferred wrap; CR, LF, BS, TAB, BEL (event); CSI cursor moves, erase, insert/delete, scroll, scroll region, save/restore; `ESC[?25h` (frame end); OSC 0/2 title (event); DCS/APC/PM/SOS skipped; `ESC c` and `ESC[!p` reset. Every other sequence, including SGR and the other private modes, is ignored.

**Row text.** At frame end `PullRowText` copies the trimmed text of every dirty row into its line. Rows Claude hard-wrapped are flagged after classification (`JoinWrappedRows`, FR-3.2a) and joined by the mirror.

**Finality.** A line is `Committed` once its row scrolled off or the screen was reset; until then it may be rewritten. Echo handling and speak-replies treat a line as settled when it is committed, followed by another visible line, or Claude is idle.

**Robustness.** The parser produces the same transcript wherever chunk boundaries fall (tested with random splits), ignores unknown sequences without desynchronising, and caps numeric parameters at 65535. Partial scroll regions have not been observed; rows they discard are dropped silently.

### 7.6 Transcript model and classification

`Line { Id; Text; Kind; HeadingLevel; JoinedToPrevious; Committed; Hidden }`. `LineKind`: `Plain`, `InputMarker`, `OutputMarker`, `System`, `UserMessage`, `Bookmark`, `UserEcho`, `ClaudeReply`, `Thinking`, `Tool`, `ToolError`, `Error`, `Warning`, `Prompt`, `PromptOption`, `TurnSummary`.

Classification runs at frame end for every uncommitted line, on the trimmed text: `^you:` UserEcho; `^claude:` ClaudeReply; `^thinking:` Thinking; `^tool:` or `(ctrl+o to expand)$` Tool; `^tool error:` ToolError; `^error:` Error; `^warning:` Warning; `^Permission Required:`, `^Enter selection`, `^Enter y/n`, `^Select with numbers` Prompt; `^\d+\. ` or `^[yn]\. ` within 12 visible lines after a Prompt → PromptOption; `^\S+ for … · done ` TurnSummary; `^\[Screen Reader Mode:` System.

Headings are structural (§4.4 item 3): inside a reply (from a `claude:` row up to the next tool, summary or other labelled row), a row of 1 to 80 characters that follows a blank row or sits on the `claude:` label row, does not end in `.`, `,`, `;`, `:`, `?` or `!`, is not a list item, has at least one letter and is followed by a blank row, is level 2. Rows outside a reply, such as tool output, never qualify, and neither does the last line of a code block, which follows another code line. Screen reader mode strips the hashes, so every markdown heading level reads as level 2; a line that still begins with `#`s uses the `#` count anywhere. The markers are level 1 (FR-4.1). App lines (`Line.IsMarker`) are never classified or hidden.

### 7.7 TranscriptView and TranscriptMirror

`TranscriptMirror` (Core, unit tested) holds the visible lines as one text with their start offsets, separators (`\r\n`, or a space for a `JoinedToPrevious` line, nothing when it starts with one), display line numbers for `l`, and the search behind Ctrl+F. `Update(lines)` compares the new visible list with the old one by line identity and separator (common prefix and suffix; everything between is replaced as one block together with the separator in front of it; a prefix or suffix line whose text changed is replaced on its own) and returns `MirrorEdit`s in descending start order plus `MapPosition(oldCaret)`: the same column of the same line when it is still shown, otherwise the start of the next line still shown, or of the replacement. A frame with no visible change returns at once; otherwise only the entries after the first changed line are recomputed, and the line lists are reused between frames, so a spinner tick allocates nothing and no 20 000-entry list goes to the large object heap. The update is valid until the next call. Reading breaks (FR-3.10) live here too: `BreakAtEnd(caretColumn)` records the last line and its length as heard, the rendering of that line then carries a `\r\n` at the resolved column (or the next joined line starts with `\r\n` instead of a space), start offsets and `MapPosition` count the extra characters, `RenderedColumn` maps a text column through them, `DisplayTextAt` and the display line numbers ignore them, and `ClearBreaks` takes them away. The view marks the end when the caret is on the last screen row of the edit control (`EM_GETLINECOUNT`, `EM_LINEFROMCHAR`) and clears once the caret's display line is not the one with the breaks.

The view applies the edits with `Select` + `SelectedText` (EM_SETSEL / EM_REPLACESEL), never `Text = …`, with redraw suspended, then restores the caret through `MapPosition`. Output within 250 ms of a key press in the focused view is held until the keys stop, because NVDA reads the caret line in several messages and text that shifts between them is read wrong; announcements and the status bar are not held. Without focus, the caret goes to the start of the last line and the view scrolls to it with `EM_SCROLLCARET` sent directly: WinForms' `ScrollToCaret` first copies the whole text. Edits land at the bottom of the text, which keeps the word-wrapped EDIT control cheap; an edit near the top re-wraps everything below it (about 0.7 s at 20 000 lines, so a trim, FR-3.6, is a rare one-off).

### 7.8 Announcer

`Announce(text, interrupt)` → `RaiseAutomationNotification(ActionCompleted, interrupt ? MostRecent : All, text)` on the transcript view, or on the notice's text or field while one shows. On `false`, the selection fallback (FR-7.6).

### 7.9 Settings and command line

`AppSettings` loads `axclaude.json` through the bundle's `SettingsFile` with `System.Text.Json` (reflection based; the app is not trimmed), sanitises ranges, writes via temp-file rename. `StartupOptions` is a hand-written parser: unknown options before `--` are errors; everything after `--` is opaque.

## 8. Design decisions

- **D1 WinForms, not WPF.** Real Win32 controls (EDIT, menus, status bar) with the most mature NVDA support; no custom UIA providers.
- **D2 A read-only multi-line `TextBox` for the transcript.** A `ListBox` has no partial selection, word wrap or character review and its type-ahead conflicts with quick keys; `RichTextBox` is slower and quirky; a custom control has a large accessibility surface. The plain EDIT control is what NVDA's own log viewer uses.
- **D3 ConPTY with screen reader mode, not `-p --output-format stream-json`.** The user wants the CLI's own interactive behaviour (slash commands, prompts, dialogs, modes) with the rendering Anthropic maintains. Stream-json drops interactive prompts unless the undocumented control protocol is implemented. It remains the fallback; the transcript and view layers would be reused.
- **D4 Own P/Invoke, no PTY package.** Five functions; the reference implementation already works.
- **D5 .NET 10 (LTS)**; `global.json` pins the SDK feature band; self-contained single-file publish.
- **D6 A screen model with diffing rather than escape stripping.** §4.2–4.4 show in-place redraws and cursor parking; stripping would duplicate or garble lines.
- **D7 App markers plus Claude's labels.** The markers are deterministic and immediate; the labels give the inner structure.
- **D8 UIA notifications for announcements.** They speak without stealing focus or moving the caret; NVDA supports them since 2018.3. Fallback: selection.
- **D9 A fixed, wide console (240 columns).** Claude hard-wraps at the console width; 240 keeps most paragraphs on one logical line and the EDIT control wraps visually. The window never resizes the console.
- **D10 No auto-speak by default.** The point is a calm, navigable buffer; the bell announcement and `o` are the fast path. Auto-speak is an option.
- **D11 Enter sends, Shift+Enter is a new line (1.5.1).** What Claude Code and most chat apps do, and one rule for the bottom of the window, where a list of answers or a field for the user's own words can take the message field's place (D33): Enter acts. Until 1.5.1 Enter sent and Enter was a new line, to keep the field an ordinary multi-line edit.
- **D12 No send lock.** Claude Code queues or steers with a message sent while it works; the app keeps the markers honest (FR-4.7) and says "Queued".
- **D13 No history recall in the message field.** Claude's own recall draws on the hidden prompt row, so it is unusable through the app, and plain Up and Down never reach Claude. The app's own recall (Up on the first line, Down on the last; 1.0.0 to 1.0.2) was removed on 2026-09-19: earlier text appearing and being spoken in the field on an ordinary arrow key was confusing, and the messages are in the conversation anyway (`i`, and Enter copies a line back).
- **D14 Ctrl+O is guarded.** Until 1.2.0 the app sent Ctrl+O to Claude because the tool summaries advertise it, and Change folder moved to Ctrl+N (since 2026-09-19 Ctrl+N is New session, FR-8.6, and Change folder is a menu item without a key). In screen reader mode the key is harmful: on an idle prompt it hides the prompt (§4.4 item 17), and while Claude works it redraws the conversation from the first message on screen downwards, as its detailed transcript and then as plain text again (item 19), so the app's transcript gained a second copy of every message and Speak replies read old replies again. The app no longer sends it: Ctrl+O announces why and points at `--verbose` (FR-7.4, item 18), the Session menu item is gone, and the model's detection of the detailed view stays as a safety net, in which case Ctrl+O is sent once to close it.
- **D15 System.Text.Json for settings.** Ships with the runtime.
- **D16 A message sent while Claude works stays out of the conversation until Claude takes it up.** Claude Code owns the queue and draws the waiting message; the app only reports it and prints the block when the echo arrives. Placing the markers at once put them in the middle of the running reply and moved them later.
- **D17 Wrapped rows are joined in the view, not in the model.** Each screen row keeps its `Line`, so rewrites and caret mapping keep working; only the separator changes. File-only switch.
- **D18 Installation is a script.** `install.ps1` does everything a per-user installer would with no dependency, no elevation and nothing to sign. `install.cmd` is how a person starts it: a downloaded `.ps1` is refused by the default execution policy and blocked as a file from the internet, and a batch file is not, so it runs `install.ps1` with `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` for that one run. Next to `install.ps1` (the zip, the installed folder) it passes its arguments on; downloaded on its own (a release asset of its own) it fetches the latest release's zip from the GitHub API into `%TEMP%\Axit-install` and runs the `install.ps1` in it. The updater (D25) still runs `install.ps1` itself. The install also writes the Apps entry (`HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\Axit`: name, version, publisher, icon, location, size, no modify or repair), so Settings, Apps and Add or remove programs list Axit; its uninstall command is `install.cmd -Uninstall` in the installed folder, which removes the entry with everything else. `install.cmd` is one parenthesised block that ends with `(goto) 2>nul`: cmd.exe reads a block whole before running it, and the uninstall deletes the folder the batch file is in, which otherwise ends in "The system cannot find the path specified." Every install first removes a previous installation completely, of any version (every installer since 1.0.0 used the same places; those before 1.5.0 wrote no Apps entry), and says what it found ("Removing AxClaude 1.4.0 (installed by the earlier installer) before installing..."), then installs fresh; the settings and the log stay. The updater runs the same script, so an update is a clean reinstall. `Remove-Installation` is shared by that and by Uninstall. Uninstall does nothing while AxClaude runs from the installed folder ("AxClaude is still running, so nothing was removed. Close it and uninstall again."), so the Apps entry and `install.cmd` stay to try again; any error nothing handles is said and written to the update log (`trap`), since the updater runs the script without a window; a download install deletes `%TEMP%\Axit-install` afterwards, and the updater keeps only the version it installs under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Axit\updates`.
- **D19 The user guide is one Markdown file**, embedded for Help → User guide and copied into the zip as `README.md`, so the two can never differ.
- **D20 Escape is guarded in the message field.** Blind users press Escape by reflex, and an unguarded one interrupted the running turn. Ctrl+Escape was the first choice, but Windows opens the Start menu on it, and swallowing it needs a global keyboard hook, which must not be installed next to a screen reader.
- **D21 Quoting a conversation line is a literal text block.** No protocol, no hidden state; the user edits or deletes it like any text. The marker under the quote tells Claude where the user's own words begin.
- **D22 The app prints the message itself; Claude's echo is only hidden.** Moving two markers around the echo broke as soon as a message held a blank line. The exchange block is text the app owns, printed once; the echo is matched by text with whitespace ignored and hidden. Nothing moves afterwards.
- **D23 The app never opens a second window of its own.** A screen reader user loses popup windows: a dialog next to the main window is easy to leave behind when the screen reader's focus moves, and then both are stuck. Every dialog is a notice drawn inside the main window by `OverlayPanel` (Find, the shortcuts, the guide, About, errors, the crash report, Claude Code was not found, the close question, the restart question, New session, the update notices); what Claude waits on goes to the control area at the bottom of the window instead (D33). Callers pass only content, a `Notice` record (title, text, buttons, at most one of a text field and the New session controls, and whether the user opened it), to the one `MainForm.ShowNotice`, which adds what every notice shares: the last line of the text made from the buttons ("Enter: Close anyway. Escape: Keep working.", "Enter or Escape: Close." for a single button; no notice words its keys itself), the notice chime (`Sounds.Notice`) and a one-second hold on Enter and Space for a notice the user did not open (errors, Claude Code was not found, the update offer at startup), the focus, the hidden conversation and field, and the blocked menu. A change to how notices look, sound or behave is made there once. The only separate windows are the standard folder, file and font pickers, and the `--help`, `--version` and bad-command-line message boxes shown before any window exists.
- **D24 Performance is measured, not assumed.** The per-frame path (parser, `EndFrame`, mirror update, EDIT control edits) was benchmarked at 20 000 lines (2026-09-19). Three wastes were found and removed: a closure allocated on every iteration of the echo loop (700 KB a frame), the mirror's full rebuild on every frame, and WinForms' `ScrollToCaret` copying the text. A frame end now costs 0.12 ms and allocates nothing at 18 000 lines, down from 0.54 ms. No further machinery (virtualised views, background parsing) is warranted.
- **D25 Updates come from GitHub releases, and the user chooses.** A release is a version tag: GitHub Actions builds the same zip that `publish.ps1` builds locally and attaches it (`.github/workflows/release.yml`, started by `release.ps1`). The app asks for the latest release once at startup (an opt-out setting) and installs only after Update now: no background downloads, no server of the app's own, no installer beyond `install.ps1`, which already exists. Handing over to the new version's own installer means the running executable is never overwritten while it runs, and a failed update leaves the installed version in place. A download counts as complete when it holds `install.ps1` and a program file of any name (1.7.0): the versions after 1.7.0 ship as `Axit.exe`, the bundle AxClaude is one app of, and their `install.ps1` keeps the hand-over parameters of this one.
- **D26 Go-to keys speak even when nothing moves.** Ctrl+Tab toggles, so a user who has lost track of the focus does not know where it will land. Ctrl+1 and Ctrl+2 name a destination, and when the focus is there already the app says the control's name (the same words NVDA uses for a real focus change): one key, one answer, whether or not the focus moved. This is on demand only (the user pressed the key), so it does not conflict with the rule that navigation never speaks by itself.
- **D27 The disclaimer is in the app and the guide, not a click-through.** The MIT licence's warranty and liability clauses are the binding text (`LICENSE`, shipped in the zip). About and the end of the user guide repeat them in full words, add that everything typed goes to Anthropic under Anthropic's terms, that Claude Code changes files and runs commands under the user's permissions, and that the project is independent of Anthropic. A first-run acceptance screen would be one more notice for a screen reader user to get through and would protect no better.
- **D28 The line being written is read in pieces.** In a word-wrapped edit control, Down Arrow on the last screen row leaves the caret where it is, and NVDA then reads that whole row again. While Claude writes, the row grows, so every Down Arrow repeated what had just been heard. Holding output back does not help (the row still grows), and announcing the new text over a notification does not either (NVDA still reads the row). Instead the view renders what arrives after the heard end on a line of its own (FR-3.10), so the native Down Arrow lands on new text only; the transcript itself, `l`, Enter, Find and the saved file are untouched, and the line is joined up again once the reader moves on.
- **D29 A selection holds output back.** Streaming edits under a selection re-select around every replacement, and NVDA reports selection changes; the only reliable way to let a screen reader user select and copy from a growing conversation is to keep the text still while text is selected (FR-3.11), as is already done for 250 ms after a key press. The status bar and the notices still move, so nothing is lost, and any arrow key lets the output catch up.
- **D30 New session options live in a notice, for this run only.** Claude Code owns its command line: the notice offers a few recommended sets and a free field rather than a menu of flags, so nothing needs updating when Claude Code adds an option. The arguments live as long as the app runs (Restart keeps them) and are not persisted: `--continue` is the standing default (FR-9.1), and a `--resume <id>` or plan mode chosen once should not silently come back next week.
- **D31 Sounds are generated, not shipped, and play through one open device.** Short sine tones, and noise bursts for the ticks, built in code (`WaveTone`): no media files, no package, and they reach a Remote Desktop client like any other audio. Until 1.2.1 they went through winmm's `PlaySound`, which opens and closes the audio device for every call: the ticks stuttered on the speaker, and once many had played they backed up (reported as clogged); its `SND_NOSTOP` flag, tried in 1.1.0, silenced the ticks for good when the device never finished a sound. `Sounds` now opens one winmm wave-out device at the first sound and keeps it for the life of the process, prepares every sound's buffer once, and plays with a single `waveOutWrite`, which queues the buffer behind whatever is playing. A chime resets the queue first, so it replaces a tick and is never delayed; a tick is dropped while its own buffer is still queued, so ticks never pile up, and a tick that arrives during a chime follows it. The wave data and the headers are pinned or unmanaged for the life of the process, since the device reads and writes them after the call returns.
- **D32 One spoken notification per frame.** Claude Code prints a whole message at once in screen reader mode, so every line of it becomes final in the same frame. One UIA notification per line was a burst of which NVDA spoke only the first few, and the survivors were choppy. The lines that become final in a frame are joined into one utterance, queued with `All` processing behind whatever NVDA is saying. What follows is NVDA's queue, not ours: Control silences it, and a navigation command, whose announcement uses `MostRecent`, replaces it, which is what the user wants at that moment. The truncated behaviour turned out to be useful in its own right, since the first line of each message is Claude's narration of the turn; it became the *First lines only* mode (FR-7.4).
- **D33 What Claude waits on takes the message field's place: the control area (1.5.1; a notice over the whole window in 1.4.0 and 1.5.0).** A question at startup (workspace trust) went unheard while the user typed, and the message sent into it was lost: Claude answers text that is not `y` or `n` with "Please answer y or n." and drops it, and in a list a letter can be a key of the screen. "Claude needs your answer" (now "Claude asks") alone did not say what was asked. Claude Code gives no machine-readable signal for these questions: hooks carry no question text, fire late, and cover neither the trust dialog nor the pickers. Screen reader mode draws every one in the same shape, though: a title, text lines, numbered or `y.`/`n.` answers (`(selected)` marks the current one), then a prompt row with the cursor on it (`Enter y/n:`, `Select with numbers [1-N]. Then Enter to submit or Escape to cancel:`) and key hints under it; `QuestionReader` reads it into a `Question` (`SessionModel.PendingQuestion`). **The control area.** While Claude waits, the bottom of the window holds one control in place of the message field (`ControlArea`, `MainForm.ShowInArea`): a list of the answers ("2. Green (current)", the current one focused), the same list with check boxes when the question takes several, a one-line field for the user's own words, or a screen's lines and keys. One control, never a group, so no key changes its meaning at the bottom of the window: Tab, Shift+Tab, Ctrl+Tab and F6 switch between the conversation and the area, Up and Down move, a number or `y`/`n` jumps to its answer (the list's own type-ahead, which a repeated key cycles through the answers it starts: 1, 10, 11), Shift and a number cycle the other way, 0 and Shift+0 cycle through the single-digit answers, Page Up and Page Down move ten items, and Home and End (also with Ctrl) reach the first and last (`ListKeys`, which every list of the area uses), Space ticks, Enter answers and Escape cancels the question or goes back a step. The control's name is the question (the title, "Question 1 of 2: …" among several, and the question's lines up to about 1000 characters, so that the review of several answers says the answers and "Ready to submit your answers?", and a long plan is not read out whole), so NVDA reads the question each time the focus comes to it; every question gets a new control, so the next one is read as well. A line over the control shows the name on screen. The conversation stays in view with everything Claude printed, the question included, to read around it. The notice of 1.4.0 hid the conversation the question was about and needed its own text, buttons, answer keys and speech; the area needs none of them, and a message cannot be sent into a question while the field is not there. **Arrival.** When Claude's cursor sits on a question, the 400 ms attention timer (FR-7.2) reads it off the screen, `QuestionRouter` sends a list of answers to the area unless the slash command sent last is a viewer or a panel, and the area shows it with the notice chime (a quick C6-E6 trill, `Sounds.Notice`) in place of "Claude asks" (the taskbar still flashes). Options → Go to Claude's questions at once, interrupting speech (`interruptForQuestions`, on by default) makes the new control take the focus wherever it was, and then speaks the question and the answer the focus is on as an interrupting notification 300 ms later, once NVDA has taken the focus change: that cuts off what NVDA was reading, a reply included, and comes last (raised at once, it was cut off by the focus reading). A focus change alone does not stop NVDA (a reply went on being read over the question; the user's own key press is what silences NVDA), and an interrupting notification raised before the focus cut off the question itself. Ctrl+Tab goes back to the conversation for the context. With the option off, nothing interrupts: when the focus was at the bottom of the window the new control takes it, and when it was in the conversation it stays there and "Claude asks: <question>" is spoken after what NVDA is reading. For a second after a control the user did not cause appears, Enter, Space, Escape and typed keys do nothing, since they were meant for the message field; after an answer or Escape goes, the keys wait up to three seconds for Claude's next screen, so that a second Enter or Escape does not reach Claude. A question that follows within three seconds of the user's answer or key comes without the chime. While Claude waits and the area is on, Speak replies (FR-7.4) does not read the rows that arrive, and since Claude draws a question's rows before its prompt row, reply speech waits 250 ms and is dropped when Claude has turned out to be waiting: they are the question, which the area reads whole, and read as reply lines they came new rows only, repeats left out ("Review your answers. → Tea. → Dinner, snacks" just before the review was read with its questions; found in NVDA's log at the Input/output level). A question is known by its title and answers (`Question.Signature`): the same one is not shown again while Claude waits on it, the next step of a multi-step screen replaces it in place, and when Claude waits on nothing any more the message field comes back, with "Question closed" when Claude closed it by itself. A question while a notice of the app's own shows waits in the area behind the notice. Claude clears a question's rows for a frame while it redraws it, so a prompt row without answers is no question, and the area changes only once the screen has settled for the attention timer. **Answers.** Claude's answer field takes typed keys: an answer goes one keystroke per character and then Enter (`SendAnswer`), since several characters in one write are a paste, which it ignores ("1 3" and "12" were dropped; 1, comma, 3 as three keystrokes gave "→ Apple, Cherry"). A question whose prompt row says `(comma- or space-separated for several)` takes several answers (`Question.AllowsSeveral`): its list has check boxes, ticked where Claude marks `(selected)`; Enter sends the ticked keys joined with commas, and with none ticked it says "Tick one with Space" Every answer is followed by "Sent: 3, Blue", with "Next question", "Review next" or "Your words next" when more follows, since the moment before it sounded like the end. Several questions in one call (the `several-questions` fixture) come one at a time under a tab row (`←   ☐ Colour   ☐ Fruit   ✔ Submit   →`), which ends the question upwards, as a header row (` ☐ Colour`) does; the tab row ticks answered questions ☒ and does not mark the current one, and Claude asks them in order, so the current one is the first ☐ (`Question.Step`). The review at the end (`Review your answers`, a `warning:` row that belongs to it, y/n) is one more question. Claude shows it after a single question with several answers too, where it only repeats what was just ticked, so the app answers it y itself when it comes within three seconds of the user's answer to the last question and has no `warning:` row (a question without an answer), and the last answer's "Sent" says nothing of a review (`MainForm.SubmitsReview`); Options → Review answers before they go to Claude (`reviewAnswers`, off by default) shows it as a question again. "Other" (the `other-answer` fixture) is an answer like any other; Claude then asks for the words on `Enter text for option 4 (Other), or Escape for the list:` (also plan approval's "No, keep planning"), a question for the user's own words (`LineClassifier.IsTextPrompt`, `SessionModel.TextPrompt`; the answers still above it are not read as a question), and the area holds a field named with the question and "You chose Other. Your answer" (`MainForm.ShowOwnAnswer`). Enter sends the words one keystroke at a time and Escape goes back to the list (1, comma, 4 and then "kiwi" gave "apple, kiwi"). A permission question (the `permission-prompt` fixture: "Permission Required: Create file", the file and a preview, 1. Yes, 2. Yes and accept edits, 3. No) starts at its `Permission Required:` row, which is its title, and a `Tip:` row inside it is skipped; its "Tab to amend" draws nothing in screen reader mode and is not offered. "Chat about this" ends the question like Escape: Claude then asks in its reply. The keys a list names besides its answers (`s` in `/model`) are not offered: they act on Claude's highlight, which a typed number does not move. **Settings.** `/config` lists its settings as a question under its tab row, which ends the question upwards, with the prompt row `Enter a number to change [1-44], or Escape to save and close:` (`Question.IsSettings`); the area names it "Claude's settings". A number flips a true-or-false setting (`QuestionOption.Switch`), so Enter on one shows True and False first and only a changed value sends the number; Enter on any other setting sends its number, and Claude's list of its values follows. The settings come back on the setting just chosen, without the chime, and Escape saves and closes. Nothing about the settings is stored in the app: every list is read off Claude's screen. **Screens.** A screen that waits for keys named on its hint row rather than on a prompt row (`/status`, `/tasks`, `/help`, `/goal`; docs/axclaude/claude-screens.md) is read by `ScreenReader`: the cursor sits on a hint row naming Escape (`↑/↓ to select · Enter to view · Esc to close`) with the screen's lines above it, or on a tab row (`Settings  Status   Config   Usage   Stats`) with the lines below it down to such a hint row; `/mobile` leaves the cursor on the row under its hint row, which is read as the screen's last line. It sets `SessionModel.PendingScreen` and counts as waiting (`PromptPending`), so the status and the close question apply. The area lists the screen's lines, which the conversation does not show for a tab screen (its rows are below the cursor, FR-3.5), then an item per key ("View (Enter)", "Close (Escape)", "Stop (x)"): Enter on a key's item sends that key alone, and Escape sends Escape. Enter on one of the screen's lines, which only inform, does what Escape does, since Enter is what a user presses to be done with an information screen (a hint that the keys are at the end was a dead end); "Closed" follows when the screen names Escape's action close, dismiss, cancel or exit. A screen is known by its title and keys (`ClaudeScreen.Signature`, not its lines, which can count up by themselves), and after a key of the user's the screen shown next replaces it even when it looks the same. **Record.** Each question or screen is recorded once as the line `Question: <title>` in front of its first row (`LineKind.Question`, `SessionModel.MarkQuestion`), found with q and Shift+Q (FR-5): Claude redraws an answered question as a one-line result (`●  User answered Claude's questions:` `· Which colour do you prefer? → Green`), so the record is what stays of it. Options → Answer Claude's questions from a list (`questionNotices`) turns the area, the guard (FR-2.10) and the screen reading off; the record and answers typed a keystroke at a time stay. `docs/axclaude/claude-screens.md` lists every slash command with what its screen shows (33 recorded with 2.1.281) and where it goes; `SlashCommands.All` is its code form.
- **D34 Personal data stays out of repositories, by code rather than by care.** Users run the app, and Claude, inside their project's repository, and this project's own development runs inside this repository. Claude's screens carry personal data: `/status` prints the account's e-mail address, organisation, session id and a pipe name, and paths name the Windows account. A raw recording (Options → Record raw stream, PtyCapture) holds all of it, and the conversation saved as text can hold it too. In 2026-09 a dump of a `/status` recording was printed unredacted into a development session. Four measures: PtyCapture's `--dump` replaces e-mail addresses, account paths, pipe names, session ids and the Windows account name with placeholders unless `--raw` is given (`Privacy.Redaction`), since the dump is how recordings are read; `PrivacyTests` fails when any file in the repository holds an e-mail address or a path into a Windows account, and runs on every push (`build.yml`); the repository's `.gitignore` ignores every `.vt` recording outside `tests/fixtures`, logs, and `axclaude-*.txt`; and the app saves recordings and conversations in Documents under names starting `axclaude-`, and, when the project folder is a git repository, lists those names in its local exclude file `.git\info\exclude` (`Privacy.GitExclude`, a marked block written at each start of Claude and removed when Options → Keep AxClaude's recordings and saved conversations out of git is turned off). The exclude file rather than the project's `.gitignore`: git reads it the same way but never commits it, so no user finds an unexpected change to their project's files, and turning the option off to commit a recording on purpose touches nothing shared.
- **D35 Tab and Shift+Tab move the focus; Claude's mode has its own key.** Until 1.5.1 Shift+Tab in the message field and the control area went to Claude, whose mode key it is, while Tab moved the focus. A screen reader user reaches for Tab and Shift+Tab to move around a window, and a key pair that moves one way and does something else the other way was confusing. It also had a cost of its own: inside `/config`, Shift+Tab switches Claude's tab, and the app took the moment between two tabs for a closed screen, moving the focus to the message field and back. Tab, Shift+Tab, Ctrl+Tab, Ctrl+Shift+Tab and F6 now all move between the conversation and the control at the bottom (`MainForm.ProcessCmdKey`), so a hidden control never takes the focus; the mode is Ctrl+Shift+M (Session → Send Shift+Tab) from anywhere. Claude's hint `(shift+tab to cycle)` is on its mode line, which the app hides and reads only for the mode itself, so the user does not hear the old key.

## 9. Repository, build and run

- `dotnet build Axit.sln`, `dotnet test Axit.sln`, `dotnet run --project src/Axit -- claude "C:\path"`, or `run.ps1`.
- `publish.ps1`: `dotnet publish src/Axit -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true` into `publish\win-x64`, plus `install.cmd`, `install.ps1`, `LICENSE` and the bundle's `docs/axit/README.md` as `README.md`, zipped as `publish\Axit-<version>-win-x64.zip`, then `install.ps1` unless `-NoInstall`. The version is `<Version>` in `src/Axit/Axit.csproj`, the bundle's (AX-3.1). The names in this item change when the installer becomes Axit's (plan step 5).
- Warnings are errors in Release; nullable enabled everywhere.
- Git: `main` is always buildable; imperative commit subjects; Co-Authored-By trailer for commits made with Claude.
- Licence: MIT (`LICENSE`), copyright Dr. Kyle Keane, www.kylekeane.com; the same line is in `src/Axit/Axit.csproj` (`Authors`, `Copyright`), Help → About, the guide and the README. The only condition is that the notice stays with copies.
- Releases (FR-1.10, D25): `release.ps1 <version>` checks that CHANGELOG.md has a `## <version>` section, runs the tests, sets `<Version>`, commits "Release <version>", tags `v<version>` and pushes. `.github/workflows/release.yml` (a `v*` tag, or `gh workflow run release.yml -f tag=v1.0.1`) checks the tag against `<Version>`, tests, runs `publish.ps1 -NoInstall` and creates the GitHub release with the zip and the CHANGELOG section (`tools/release-notes.ps1`) as notes. `.github/workflows/build.yml` runs the tests on every push to `main` and every pull request.

## 10. Testing

Unit tests (xunit, `tests/AxClaude.Tests`; `TestHelpers` holds what they share: the fixture files, feeding a model, applying mirror edits):

- FixtureTests: each `tests/fixtures/*.vt` parses to its `*.expected.txt`; random chunk boundaries give the same transcript; wrapped reply rows join and tool rows do not.
- ReplayTests: `long-message` and `steering` replayed chunk by chunk with the app's send timing; the exchange block precedes the hidden echo, also for a message sent while Claude works.
- SessionModelTests: the exchange block and echo hiding (blank lines, wrapped rows), a message sent while Claude works (held until its echo; the fallback), time stamps, the join rule, slash commands and prompt answers, mode announcements, the Ctrl+O view, rows below the cursor, rewrites, scrolling, blank rows, wide characters, reset, heading levels, bookmarks (toggling and numbering; a wrapped line, and the join and heading rules around a bookmark).
- TranscriptMirrorTests: edits and caret mapping (appends, a rewritten line, inserts and removals above the caret, a hidden line, a replaced block, joined lines, a separator change), display line counting, the search, and, for every frame of every fixture, the edits reproduce the visible text and a caret stays on its line.
- ArrivalsTests: one utterance per frame in each speech mode, the tick and the tool tick, nothing spoken twice or from a replay, and the recorded conversations spoken line for line.
- ReadingBreakTests: the unheard text on a line of its own, a mark that moves in front of a cut word, every frame of every fixture, and the plain text back once the breaks are cleared.
- SettingsTests: round trip; a missing or broken file falls back to the defaults; the 1.1 `speakReplies` key.
- UpdateCheckTests: GitHub's release JSON, the version comparison, a release without the zip.
- WaveToneTests: the WAV header, the amplitude, a pause, the decay and attack of the strikes.
- ClaudeLauncherTests: splitting and joining the Custom arguments of New session.

The WinForms code has no automated tests; `docs/axclaude/nvda-test-plan.md` covers it, and off-screen probe forms check layout and key handling without disturbing the user. Fixtures are recorded with `tools/PtyCapture` and reviewed for personal data before commit (`tests/fixtures/README.md`).

## 11. Risks and open questions

| Id | Risk | Mitigation |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| R1 | ConPTY emits an unexpected repaint pattern that the screen model turns into duplicated or lost lines. | Screen model plus fixtures; Record raw stream captures the stream when it happens. |
| R2 | NVDA does not speak UIA notifications on some machine. | Selection fallback (FR-7.6). |
| R3 | Enter in the same chunk, bracketed paste through ConPTY. | Resolved by the recordings (§4.4 items 1, 8, 14). |
| R4 | Claude Code changes its labels or rendering. | Fixtures pin the version; CLAUDE.md asks for a new fixture per version bump; patterns live in one class. |
| R5 | The EDIT control slows down on very large transcripts. | The cap (FR-3.6); edits land at the bottom (§7.7). |
| R6 | Slash-command autocomplete needs a second Enter. | Enter on an empty field sends a bare Enter. |
| R7 | The user's `tui: fullscreen` setting. | Ignored in screen reader mode; `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ALTERNATE_SCREEN=1` as belt and braces. |
| R8 | The heading heuristic misses a heading or promotes a short line. | Conservative rule; `o`, `d` and `c` give reliable coarse navigation. |
| R9 | Tool detail rows collapse at the end of a turn. | Matches the terminal; Record raw stream keeps everything. |
| R10 | Claude changes how a waiting message is drawn. | The `steering` fixture pins it; a change degrades to a visible echo, not scrambled markers. |

All questions are decided (2026-09-19). **Q1** the name is AxClaude, released under it; **Q2** `# Input n` and `# Output n Reply from Claude`; **Q3** the `you:` echo is hidden (FR-4.2); **Q4** `o` targets the output marker and `c` Claude's own `claude:` lines (FR-5); **Q5** a sound on the bell (FR-7.3).

## 12. Status

Built 2026-09-18 to 2026-09-19: everything in §5, checked with NVDA (test plan sections 1 to 10) on the development build. The 2026-09-19 consolidation pass simplified every announcement, menu label and document, removed unused code (OSC 133, bracketed paste, soft-wrap and cursor-column tracking, unused view members) and fixed the per-frame wastes (D24).

Released 1.0.0 on 2026-09-19 through the release workflow (§9), with the MIT licence, the update check (FR-1.10) and the bookmarks. 1.0.1 (the version items in Help, the update notice at startup) and 1.0.2 (Ctrl+1 / Ctrl+2, the disclaimer, the reading breaks, the selection) followed the same day; CHANGELOG.md has the details.

1.1.0 (New session, the sounds, the `--continue` default with the replay blocks, the paragraph key, the jump history, the comment marker), 1.2.0 (New session clears the conversation, the three speech modes and the spoken tool calls, the tool tick, the field's page keys, Open current folder) and 1.2.1 (the Ctrl+O guard) followed on the same day. 1.3.0 (2026-09-20): the sounds play through one open wave-out device (D31), the tick option names both ticks, a folder change clears the conversation (FR-8.3), Restart Claude is announced, `run.ps1 -New`, and PtyCapture records through `PtyHost`.

1.4.0 (2026-09-24, from the branch `answer-notice`), checked with NVDA by the user: Claude's real questions (`/model`), the guard, the screen notice (`/tasks`, `/status`), the answer notice through the trial menu Help → Try the answer notice, since removed (the chime, "Claude asks:", the focus on the current answer, answer keys, Enter, Escape, Alt+M), the Force Claude to restart? notice, the Close AxClaude? notice with background work, and the key line at the end of the notices (D23, D33, FR-1.7, FR-1.8). The repaint handling (§4.4 item 20) waits for a long session to show that no old content is read out.

1.5.0 and 1.5.1 (2026-09-25): the own-answer field, check boxes, the `Question:` record, install.cmd, the control area in the message field's place. 1.6.0 (2026-09-25): wrapped answers, the review submitted for the user, Enter closing a screen, the list keys, Tab and Shift+Tab as focus keys with Ctrl+Shift+M for the mode (D35), the mode line kept out of spoken replies, and personal data kept out of recordings and repositories (D34). Test plan section 12 was checked with NVDA by the user on 1.6.0, and the earlier sections named in the to-do list below were confirmed the same day.

To do:

- [x] (Confirmed by the user on 2026-09-25.) An NVDA run of the released build with the test plan: the bookmarks (4.13), the update flow (11), Ctrl+1 / Ctrl+2 (1.4a), the About notice with the disclaimer (D27), the reading breaks (3.4, 4.9, 4.11), the selection (3.5), the Ctrl+O guard (5.4), the New session notice (7.5, 7.6), the sounds, the tick and the tool tick (8.6), the three speech modes and the spoken tool calls (9.2), the field's page keys (2.7), Open current folder and Ctrl+W (7.1), the paragraph key (4.4), the `--continue` default (7.7, 7.8) and the removed history recall (2.6, 6.1). Anything found goes into the next release through `release.ps1`.
- [ ] A pass with a second user for impressions before the app is called complete.
- [ ] Claude's questions and screens (D33, docs/axclaude/claude-screens.md). Done in 1.5.1: the control area in place of the notices, `/config`, `/mobile`, a background agent's bare "↓ to manage" on the mode line counted as background work, `/mcp` and `/hooks` tried; a list's extra keys (`s` in `/model`) are not offered, since they act on Claude's highlight, which typed numbers do not move. Left: the lines of a tab screen (`/status`, `/help`) in the conversation, not only in the notice; `/chrome` and a new theme in `/theme`; the commands still marked not known.
- [ ] Confirm in a long session that no old content is read out (§4.4 item 20) and watch for messages that never reach Claude (seen once on 2026-09-23, no trace in any session file).
- [ ] **Bug (2026-10-02, queued after the Axit transition, plan step 10):** a question Claude Code asked with its AskUserQuestion tool, two questions of three and two answers, "kept refiring" in the control area: the question came back again and again until the user dismissed it. Likely the control area being rebuilt for every redraw of the same question (the list is new for every question, D33, and the signature must tell a redraw from a new question), or the review/next-question flow of several questions looping. Reproduce with Options → Record raw stream and NVDA's log at Input/output level, then fix; the `several-questions` fixture is the starting point.
- [ ] **Bug (2026-10-02, queued with the one above):** an own-words answer (the Other field) of about a hundred characters arrived at Claude with most characters dropped ("PLSE E DAU NA ML C KS…"). The answer goes one keystroke per character with Enter at the end (FR-2 notes, the `other-answer` fixture checked short answers only); Claude's answer field loses keys sent at that pace. Fix: pace the keystrokes (a few milliseconds apart, or wait for each echo), or find the write size Claude's field accepts without treating it as a paste. Until then, long answers are safer typed as a message.

## Appendix A — Control sequences the screen model handles

C0: BEL (event), BS, HT (next multiple of 8), LF/VT/FF (line feed), CR, ESC. Other C1 and control bytes are ignored.

ESC: `7` save cursor, `8` restore, `D` index, `E` next line, `M` reverse index, `c` reset; sequences with intermediates (charset designations) are ignored.

CSI (parameters default to 1 unless noted): `A` up, `B` down, `C` forward, `D` back, `E` next line, `F` previous line, `G` and `` ` `` column, `H`/`f` position, `d` row, `J` erase in display (0/1/2), `K` erase in line (0/1/2), `X` erase characters, `@` insert blanks, `P` delete characters, `L` insert lines, `M` delete lines, `S` scroll up, `T` scroll down, `r` scroll region, `s`/`u` save/restore, `! p` soft reset. `? 25 h` ends a frame; every other private mode, SGR (`m`) and every query is ignored.

OSC: `0`/`2` title (event); others ignored. DCS, APC, PM, SOS: skipped to ST.

Cell width: `Wcwidth` returns 0 for combining marks and format characters, 2 for East Asian wide and emoji ranges, 1 otherwise. Continuation cells are skipped when a row is read.

## Appendix B — Keys sent to Claude

| Action | Bytes |
| :-- | :-- |
| Enter | `\r` |
| Escape (Shift+Escape in the app) | `\x1b` |
| Ctrl+C | `\x03` |
| Ctrl+D | `\x04` |
| Tab | `\t` |
| Shift+Tab | `\x1b[Z` |
| Up / Down | `\x1b[A` / `\x1b[B` |
| Ctrl+O | `\x0f`, only to close Claude's detailed view should it be open (D14) |
| Ctrl+J (newline inside the draft) | `\n` as a write of its own |

ConPTY converts these to key events for the client; win32-input-mode is not used.

## Appendix C — Settings file

```json
{
  "lastProjectFolder": "C:\\projects\\myproject",
  "recentFolders": ["C:\\projects\\myproject"],
  "claudePath": null,
  "ptyColumns": 240,
  "ptyRows": 50,

}
```

`fontFamily` null with `fontSize` 0 is the Windows message font. `claudePath` is set by Locate claude.exe or by hand. `joinWrappedLines` has no menu item. `checkForUpdates` is Options → Check for updates when AxClaude starts (FR-1.10). `questionNotices` is Options → Answer Claude's questions from a list (D33): off, the control area never takes the message field's place, the guard of FR-2.10 is off, and screens that wait on a hint row are not looked for, so what Claude waits on is only announced, as before 1.4.0; the `Question:` record and answers typed a keystroke at a time stay. `interruptForQuestions` is Options → Go to Claude's questions at once, interrupting speech (D33). `reviewAnswers` is Options → Review answers before they go to Claude (D33): off, the app submits Claude's review itself. `keepFilesOutOfGit` is Options → Keep AxClaude's recordings and saved conversations out of git (D34). `soundOnBell` keeps its 1.0 name and covers the sent, responding, done and question chimes (FR-7.3); `clickOnNewLine` is the tick (FR-7.8). `replySpeech` is `none`, `firstLines` or `all` (FR-7.4); the 1.1 key `speakReplies: true` is read as `all` and no longer written; `speakToolCalls` is Options → Speak each tool call. Written atomically; a missing or unreadable file gives the defaults and a system line. Marker formats and chrome patterns are fixed in code: a pattern change needs a fixture anyway.

## Appendix D — Glossary

- **ConPTY / pseudo console:** the Windows API that lets a program host a console application and exchange a VT byte stream with it.
- **VT sequence:** an escape sequence that moves the cursor, erases text or changes modes.
- **Screen reader mode:** Claude Code's `--ax-screen-reader` rendering.
- **Marker line:** a line the app inserts (`# Input n`, `# Output n Reply from Claude`, `System:`).
- **Exchange block:** the input marker, the message, a blank line, the output marker, a blank line (FR-4.1).
- **Bookmark:** an app line `Bookmark n` that the reader drops in front of a line with `m` and finds again with `k` (FR-3.9).
- **Quick key:** a single-letter navigation command in the transcript view, modelled on NVDA browse mode.
- **UIA notification:** a UI Automation event that asks screen readers to speak a string without changing focus.
